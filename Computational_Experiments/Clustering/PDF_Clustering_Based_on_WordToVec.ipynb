While we estimate a YE2022 cash balance of $140M, the prioritization of certain\\nR&D efforts and workforce reductions should extend the cash runway until early 2025.\\nWith gavo-cel clinical efforts solely on ovarian cancer, we expect value-generating Phase\\n2 data should be available within this timeline, potentially starting with initial duration of\\nresponse data in 2H23. TCR2 will also accelerate next-gen programs TC-510 and TC-520,\\nwith Phase 1 ORR data for TC-510 (PD1-switch) expected in 2H23. We adjust our model\\nfor the 40% workforce reduction and R&D re-prioritization. We removed gavo-cel estimates\\nfor MPM, CCA and NSCLC, but retained ovarian, increasing the probability to 65% given\\nprogress to durability data. We push out our DCF valuation by 6-months and our PT\\nincreases to $10 from $8.\\n• Cost cutting to extend cash runway. TCR2 plans to reduce the workforce by 40% by\\nthe end of January 2023 and adjust the manufacturing network as cost saving measures.\\nGavo-cel Phase 2 program will focus on ovarian cancer to generate more robust data\\nin a shorter timeline, with other indications deprioritized, including mesothelioma given\\na lower market opportunity. Cost savings are expected to extend cash runway into early\\n2025, with potential key clinical catalysts expected in 2H23.\\n• Gavo-cel Phase 2 on pace for OVA durability data in 2H23. Phase 2 gavo-cel trial will\\nnarrow focus to ovarian cancer (OVA), which had a strong Phase 1 signal and provides\\na better cost:benefit opportunity. While the majority of Phase 1 patients were MPM, OVA\\nhad a similar efficacy signal, with 29% ORR, 5.8 month PFS, and 8.1 month OS. With\\nPhase 2 solely focused on OVA, mgmt estimates meaningful durability data in 2H23.\\nGiven meaningful DOR requires sufficient follow-up and a good number of objective\\nresponses, we believe this timeline update means — 1) OVA cohort has been enrolling\\nwell and 2) responses have already been seen. We believe positive data would provide\\nmeaningful upside, given shares trade at 0.3x cash.\\n• Accelerating next-gen TC-510 and TC-520. Mgmt will also focus on next-generation\\nTRuC-T therapies, TC-510 (PD1-switch) and TC-520 (CD70/IL-15), which should build\\non the success of gavo-cel. Phase 1 study for TC-510 is currently enrolling 115 patients\\nwith MSLN+ MPM, ovarian, pancreatic, colorectal, and TNBC. Mgmt now expects\\nmeaningful ORR data in 2H23, likely from more than one cohort.\\nRISKS TO ACHIEVEMENT OF PT & RECOMMENDATION\\nDelay in starting Phase 2, limited efficacy in larger study, and safety concerns\\nCOMPANY DESCRIPTION\\nTCR2 is clinical stage biotech developing TRuC-T cell therapies for solid tumors\\nPage 1 of 4\\nTCR2 Therapeutics, Inc.\\nPiper Sandler does and seeks to do business with companies covered in its research reports.

Recall that alongside with 3Q results, the company announced a voluntary \\nenrollment pause of the SAD portion of the healthy volunteer phase 1 study for Wnt \\nmimetic SZN-1326 due to treatment-related adverse events, as well as similar \\nalbeit less severe events identified with SZN-043. From our discussion with \\ncompany, we note that while much remains unknown as to the underlying \\nmechanism behind the liver transaminase elevations observed with both \\ncandidates, to the extent the events are a consequence of on-target activity (mgmt \\nnoting several upregulated Wnt target genes that could be at play), we see \\nformidable risks for the future of the company’s pipeline and overall platform \\ngiven the common focus on Wnt pathway activation. The company has speculated \\nimmune mediated response as an alternate driver of poor liver tolerability, \\nhowever, that similar adverse events were not observed in various animal models \\nunderscores concerns that Surrozen’s preclinical data (including efficacy) may not \\nhold much predictive utility.  With the SZN-1326 study paused and the SZN-043 \\nstudy proceeding with caution,  next steps and timelines for both programs largely \\nunclear (internal diligence to be conducted to identify AE mechanism), with \\nprevious catalyst and cash runway guidance no longer to be relied on (prior \\nguidance 1H24 comprising phase 1b for both programs). To that end, in view of an \\nuncertain catalyst outlook and potential dilutive pressures prior to meaningful \\nclinical data, we see SRZN shares underperforming relative to our broader \\ncoverage over the mid-term.  \\n•\\nDowngrading to Underweight\\nSee page 6 for analyst certification and important disclosures.\\nJ.P.

Morgan ratings or designations: OW = Overweight, N= Neutral, UW = Underweight, NR = Not Rated\\nExplanation of Equity Research Ratings, Designations and Analyst(s) Coverage Universe: \\nJ.P. Morgan uses the following rating system: Overweight [Over the next six to twelve months, we expect this stock will outperform the average \\ntotal return of the stocks in the analyst’s (or the analyst’s team’s) coverage universe.] Neutral [Over the next six to twelve months, we expect \\nthis stock will perform in line with the average total return of the stocks in the analyst’s (or the analyst’s team’s) coverage universe.] \\nUnderweight [Over the next six to twelve months, we expect this stock will underperform the average total return of the stocks in the analyst’s \\n(or the analyst’s team’s) coverage universe.] Not Rated (NR): J.P. Morgan has removed the rating and, if applicable, the price target, for this \\nstock because of either a lack of a sufficient fundamental basis or for legal, regulatory or policy reasons. The previous rating and, if applicable, \\nthe price target, no longer should be relied upon. An NR designation is not a recommendation or a rating. In our Asia (ex-Australia and ex-India) \\nand U.K. small- and mid-cap equity research, each stock’s expected total return is compared to the expected total return of a benchmark country \\nmarket index, not to those analysts’ coverage universe.

Initiating Coverage with\\n$22 PT\\nKey Message: We are initiating coverage of ACET with a BUY rating and $22 PT. ACET is a clinical stage Biotech company focused\\non developing engineered T cell-based anti-cancer therapies that utilize a unique class of T lymphocytes called γδ T cells. Resulting\\ntherapies hold the promise to potentially generate more durable clinical activity while having a more favorable safety profile and could\\nbe particularly attractive in addressing solid tumors given the unique properties of γδ T cells. ACET has built a differentiated γδ T cell\\nplatform taking advantage of its proprietary manufacturing process, which has generated a pipeline of product candidates addressing\\nsolid and hematological cancers including ACET-001 (anti-CD20 γδ CAR-T), which is in Phase I for lymphomas, and ADI-002, which\\ntargets GPC3 in solid tumors (IND in 2021). We think ACET currently trades at an attractive valuation at a fully diluted MCap of\\n$420M/EV of $193M and is well financed with cash runway into 1H23 and believe ACET shares are set up well to outperform the XBI\\nlonger term as the company successfully advances development of existing product candidates towards clinical POC and via general\\nvalidation of γδ T cell technology driven by increasing industry interest in the technology.\\nOur rating on ACET is BUY and our 12-month PT is $22/share. ACET is a clinical stage Biotech company focused on developing\\nT cell-based anti-cancer therapies that utilize a unique subset of T lymphocytes called γδ T cells. γδ T cells could support a potentially\\ndifferentiated class of cell therapies that combine advantages of both more commonly used off-the-shelf CAR αβ T cells & CAR-NK cells.\\nγδ CAR-T cells hold the promise to generate more durable clinical activity while having a more favorable safety profile and could be\\nparticularly attractive in addressing solid tumors given their natural tissue homing capability and by combining components of the adaptive\\n& innate immune system to generating a multi-antigen response. Given their unique biology as well as numerous studies demonstrating\\na correlative relationship between the presence of γδ T cells and positive clinical outcomes across patients with various cancer types,\\ntherapeutic γδ T cell platforms are gaining increased attention across the industry. ACET remains differentiated within a field of emerging\\ncompanies by its proprietary manufacturing capabilities, which isolate a minority γδ T cell subset, Vδ1, which naturally home to tissues\\nand have shown superior cytotoxicity in ACET\\'s preclinical analyses. ACET is currently progressing 2 lead programs: ADI-001 (anti-CD20\\nCAR-T) for r/r NHL and ADI-002 (anti-GPC3 CAR-T) for HCC/ solid tumors. The former is being evaluated in an ongoing Ph. I dose\\nescalation study with initial early data on track for disclosure in 2021, while the latter (which currently falls under ACET’s collaboration with\\nREGN) is on track for IND filing in 2021 and clinical trial initiation in early 2022. Our base-case valuation of $22/share assumes 20% PoS\\nfor ADI-001, 10% PoS for ADI-002, 2% PoS for 5 future IND submissions planned for 2022 and onwards, representing “platform value”\\nas well as estimated cash in one year. In an upside scenario, in which early ADI-001 Ph. I data at year-end shows early clinical POC, we\\nbelieve ACET could be valued at $31/ share, whereas in a downside scenario, we estimate ACET could be worth $8/share in 1 year.\\nGiven their unique biology, γδ T cell-based therapies could represent an intriguing new class of therapeutics within the adoptive\\ncell therapy space. γδ T cells differ from the more common αβ T cell population in that γδ T cells (i) have TCRs that do not require\\nMHC presentation and have been shown not to elicit GvHD, (ii) harness both adaptive & innate cytotoxicity via expression of both T-cell\\nreceptors & NK-cell receptors recognizing a broad spectrum of tumor antigens, (iii) have tissue-resident features given their propensity\\nto home to tumors. As such, therapeutic applications utilizing γδ CAR-T cells hold the promise to potentially generate potent and more\\ndurable anti-cancer activity relative to “traditional” αβ CAR-T or CAR-NK cells (given multi-antigen targeting) while also potentially having\\na safety/ tolerability profile akin to NK cell therapies. Importantly, numerous studies have identified a correlative relationship between\\nthe presence of γδ T cells and positive clinical outcomes (e.g., overall survival, disease-free survival, and prognosis) among patients\\nGUGGENHEIM SECURITIES, LLC\\nPage 1\\nSee pages 45 - 46 for analyst certification and important disclosures.\\nFor the exclusive use of Jonathan Livescault (jlivescault@pwpartners.com) at Perella Weinberg Partners\\nwith various cancer types. As such, despite the early development stage and remaining uncertainties regarding the potential of CAR-\\nenhanced γδ T cells, we expect ACET to gain more visibility with investors as the company (and potential competitor platforms) moves\\ncloser towards clinical POC over the next 1-2 years.\\nACET has built a differentiated γδ T cell platform taking advantage of its proprietary manufacturing process. γδ T cells are\\nclassified into subset populations based on composition of the TCR, of which the most common are Vδ1 & Vδ2. While Vδ2 represent the\\nmajority of γδ T cells in the peripheral blood, Vδ1 is the predominant subset in solid tissues where they are well adapted to low oxygen,\\nlow nutrient environments. ACET developed proprietary manufacturing techniques to selectively expand various γδ T cell subsets and,\\nbased on superior characteristics in preclinical analyses including higher cytotoxicity and improved tissue homing, opted to build its γδ T\\ncell platform using the Vδ1 subset of cells. This focus differentiates ACET from competitors in the field that primarily use Vδ2 cells given\\ntheir substantially increased prevalence and thus relative ease of harvest relative to the minority subpopulation of Vδ1 cells. As such,\\nACET’s platform could be uniquely well positioned among the broader cell therapy field to address solid tumors.\\nACET’s lead program ADI-001 targets well-validated CD20 and is currently being evaluated in a Ph. I clinical trial with early\\ninitial data on track for year-end. Following IND clearance in October 2020, ACET initiated the Ph. I dose escalation trial of ADI-001\\nin 1Q21 in patients with relapsed/refractory non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma (NHL) progressing after 2 or more prior lines of therapy. Following\\nlymphodepletion with standard cy/flu doses, ADI-001 will be evaluated in 3 dose cohorts with potential expansion cohorts/ pivotal studies\\ninto DLBCL and MCL. ACET has guided to presenting initial Ph. I data from this study by year-end, which, given trial initiation in 1Q21, we\\nexpect will likely include a handful of patients treated at the lower dose cohorts with varying durations of follow-up. As such, investors are\\nlikely to focus their attention on (i) safety/tolerability, (ii) PK/ cell expansion kinetics, and (iii) preliminary signs of anti-tumor activity. We\\nthink a dataset on par in quantity to that presented, e.g., by ALLO (link) at ASCO 2020 is more likely to come in 2022 and represents a major\\nde-risking catalyst for ADI-001 as well as ACET’s broader platform. Longer term, we think off-the-shelf cell therapies within lymphomas\\nwill need to at least match the efficacy/safety bar set forth by approved autologous CAR-T therapies (i.e., GILD’s Yescarta & Tecartus,\\nNVS’ Kymriah, and BMY’s Breyanzi) in order to be commercially successful, an opportunity that we estimate represents a PoS-adjusted\\n$1.7Bn U.S. market opportunity by 2030 across DLBCL & MCL indications. Based on the limited clinical proof-of-concept data generated\\nto date across the CAR γδ T cell space, we currently assume a 20% PoS for ADI-001 and $400M WW PoS-adjusted peak sales.\\nACET’s lead program in solid tumors ADI-002 targets GPC3, which, although less well validated than CD20, has a high degree\\nof differentiation of expression in tumors & healthy tissues and therefore could represent a compelling target. Studies have\\ndemonstrated that GPC3 is highly expressed on numerous solid tumors including HCC, squamous cell carcinoma of the lung, etc., but\\nhas minimal expression on normal tissue. In addition to a GPC3 CAR, ADI-002 also expresses soluble IL-15 to potentially increase\\nproliferative ability and durability. ACET plans to submit an IND for ADI-002 by year-end, with Phase I trial initiation anticipated in 2022.\\nNotably, ADI-002 falls under the 5-year collaboration between ACET & REGN in which the 2 parties can choose to co-fund, co-promote,\\nand profit-share this product candidate. As such, REGN’s “opt-in” decision around the IND package preparation/filing at year-end could\\nprovide a small de-risking catalyst for ACET later this year. Given the historical difficulties faced by cell therapies in solid tumor settings,\\nwe conservatively estimate 10% PoS and $100M PoS-adjusted WW peak sales.\\nACET is also pursuing a platform extension with TCR-like antibodies that could potentially open the opportunity to target\\nintracellular proteins. To potentially expand the cell therapy footprint, ACET is leveraging its γδ T cell platform to develop TCR-like\\n(TCRL) antibodies to eventually be used as receptors to target the antigen:MHC complex (e.g., antigens when bound to the MHC receptor).\\nIf successful, this could allow CARs to address targets currently only accessible via TCRs (naturally occurring or enhanced), which would\\nbe highly differentiated among the cell therapy field, opening up novel targets to ACET not available to other platforms. Given the early\\nstage of this program, we view this platform extension as potential longer-term upside at the current ACET valuation.\\nGUGGENHEIM SECURITIES, LLC\\nPage 2\\nSee pages 45 - 46 for analyst certification and important disclosures.\\nFor the exclusive use of Jonathan Livescault (jlivescault@pwpartners.com) at Perella Weinberg Partners\\nInitiation of Coverage for\\nAdicet Bio, Inc.

ACET is a clinical stage \\nBiotech company focused on developing γδ T cell-based therapies. γδ T cells could offer a potentially differentiated new class of cell therapies that \\ncombine advantages of both off-the-shelf CAR αβ T cells & CAR-NK cells, harnessing both adaptive & innate immune responses that offer a multi-\\nantigen targeting approach, which could potentially result in highly potent anti-tumor activity with a more favorable safety profile relative to other \\ncellular immunotherapies, namely αβ CAR-T cells. ACET’s lead product candidates target CD20 (hematologic malignancies) and GPC3 (HCC, solid \\ntumors); the former is currently being evaluated in an ongoing Phase I study with a first clinical data readout on track for 2021, which could provide \\ninitial clinical POC for ACET’s platform.\\n•\\nLead product candidate, ADI-001, is an anti-CD20 CAR γδ T cell therapy. ADI-001 is currently in a Phase I dose-escalation study in NHL patients \\nwith disclosure of first clinical interim data guided for 2021. This agent could potentially compete with emerging CD19 CAR-T and CD19 CAR-NK cell \\ntherapies as well as CD20 bispecific antibodies and could penetrate a $1.7B U.S. TAM by 2030 should it demonstrate a differentiated clinical profile.\\n•\\nACET’s lead product candidate for solid tumors, ADI-002, targets GPC3. GPC3, while less clinically validated as a drug target, has been shown to \\nbe highly expressed on numerous solid tumors with minimal expression in normal tissues. ACET plans to submit an IND for ADI-002 by year-end, with \\nPhase I trial initiation anticipated in early 2022.\\n•\\nACET is also advancing a TCR-like (TCRL) platform to address intracellular proteins. To potentially expand the cell therapy footprint, ACET is \\nleveraging its γδ T cell platform to develop TCR-like (TCRL) antibodies to eventually be used as receptors to target the antigen:MHC complex (e.g., \\nantigens when bound to the MHC receptor).\\nCompany Background\\nPipeline Newsflow & Outlook\\nSource: Guggenheim Securities, LLC, Research\\n*Potential Stock Impact: + low, ++ medium, +++ high; positive/negative\\n**Our view: + low conviction, ++ medium conviction, +++ high conviction\\nAgent\\nIndication\\nTrial\\nCatalyst\\nTiming\\nACET Stock \\nImpact*\\nOur View**\\nADI-001 (CD20)\\nNHL\\nPhase I\\nInitial results\\n2021\\n++\\n++\\nNHL\\nPhase I\\nUpdated results\\n2022E\\n+++\\n++\\nADI-002 (GPC3)\\nHCC\\nPreclinical\\nIND submission\\n2021\\n+\\n+++\\nADI-00x (target TBD)\\nSolid tumors\\nDiscovery\\nIND submission\\n2022\\n+\\n+\\nADI-00x (multiple targets)\\nSolid & hematologic tumors\\nDiscovery\\nIND submission\\n2023\\n+\\n+\\nGUGGENHEIM SECURITIES, LLC\\nPage 7\\nSee pages 45 - 46 for analyst certification and important disclosures.\\nFor the exclusive use of Jonathan Livescault (jlivescault@pwpartners.com) at Perella Weinberg Partners\\nACET – Bear Case, Bull Case, Guggenheim View\\nBull Case: Differentiated cell therapy platform that could \\nsupport potentially best-in-class CAR-T assets, particularly in \\nsolid tumor indications\\n•\\nACET is one of the leaders of the new wave of companies \\npursuing γδ T cell-based therapies with a differentiated platform \\nfocused on the Vδ1 subset.\\n•\\nIts platform is potentially well suited to address solid tumors, a \\nhistorically challenging setting for cell therapies.\\n•\\nADI-001 addresses a clinically validated target (CD20) and \\ncould potentially provide a non-CD19-based approach to the \\ntreatment of NHL that could generate a differentiated clinical \\nprofile vs. existing CAR αβ T cell and CAR NK cell therapies.\\n•\\nIt has a highly differentiated TCRL platform that, if successful, \\ncould address intracellular targets, expanding the cell therapy \\nfootprint in oncology.\\nBear Case: Early-stage company pursuing competitive/over-\\nsaturated markets with still-to-be-de-risked cell therapy \\nstrategy\\n•\\nACET’s pipeline is still very early stage with its most advanced \\nproduct candidate having just recently entered Phase I.\\n•\\nDevelopment risks around γδ T cell-based therapies exist, and \\ncurrent CAR-T therapies in NHL have already set a high \\nefficacy bar.\\n•\\nThere are existing investor doubts on the potential of cell \\ntherapies in solid tumors given largely unsuccessful/ \\nunderwhelming data to date.\\nDifferentiated γδ T cell-based platform that could potentially address \\nsolid tumors. ACET has built a unique γδ T cell platform distinct from \\ncompetitors that could potentially generate off-the-shelf therapies that \\nharness the advantages of both αβ T cells (e.g., high efficacy) and NK cells \\n(e.g., good safety/ tolerability). \\nWe think the risk/reward owning ACET is favorable given the current \\nmarket valuation of $420M and EV of $193M while the company is well \\nfinanced with cash runway into 1H23. We believe ACET shares are set \\nup well to outperform the XBI longer as the company successfully advances \\ndevelopment of existing product candidates towards clinical POC and also \\nvia general validation of γδ T cell technology driven by increasing industry \\ninterest in this technology.\\n\\uf0a7\\nACET’s lead program ADI-001 targets well-validated CD20 and is \\ncurrently being evaluated in a Ph. I clinical trial with early initial \\ndata on track for year-end representing a potential near-term \\ncatalyst.

RHHBY published data from its randomized Ph. II trial back in 2016, which included 185 \\npatients with advanced HCC who had failed prior systemic therapy. mPFS was 2.6 months (vs. 1.5 months for \\nplacebo) and mOS was 8.7 months (vs. 10 for placebo). The authors cited that it remains unknown whether CD16 or \\nGPC3 biomarkers would have improved efficacy. Shortly thereafter at ASCO 2017, CARsgen presented initial data \\non CAR-GPC3 in 5 patients with r/r HCC. The data reported 1 PR, 2 SD, 2 PD with 4/5 patients still alive at 10-20 \\nmonths. Given these findings, GPC3 likely needs additional data to gain more investor confidence around target \\nvalidation, likely resulting in a low PoS for ADI-002 initially.\\nACET has guided to filing an IND for ADI-002 later in 2021 with potential first patient treated in 2022. This \\nproduct candidate falls under the REGN collaboration (see pg. 37) and, as such, could be split up to 50:50 with \\nREGN following opt-in periods.\\nGUGGENHEIM SECURITIES, LLC\\nPage 34\\nSee pages 45 - 46 for analyst certification and important disclosures.\\nFor the exclusive use of Jonathan Livescault (jlivescault@pwpartners.com) at Perella Weinberg Partners\\nTo potentially expand cell therapy footprint into intracellular proteins, ACET is \\nleveraging its γδ T cell platform to develop TCR-like (TCRL) antibodies\\nSource: Guggenheim Securities, LLC; ACET corporate presentation\\nCurrent antibodies and CARs recognize molecules present on the surface of cells. For example, existing \\ntargets in B cell malignancies (e.g., CD19 & CD20) are surface proteins present on both tumor cells & healthy cells, \\nwhich leads to systemic depletion of any CD19/CD20-expressing cells upon targeted therapy administration. While \\nthis on-target toxicity can be managed in some settings (e.g., in the case of B cell malignancies), it can lead to \\nsignificant toxicities and even death with therapies of other targets (e.g., HER2, EGFR).\\nACET is developing TCR-like antibodies to potentially allow cell \\ntherapies to gain exposure to intracellular proteins. Recall, intracellular \\nproteins represent ~50% of proteins found in human cells and can have \\nmore distinct tumor-only patterns. However, for immune cells to recognize \\nthese intracellular proteins, they must be presented as antigens on MHC \\nmolecules. As such, cell therapies aiming to target these intracellular \\nproteins must be designed to recognize the antigen + MHC complex. To do \\nthis, ACET analyzes peptides expressed by MHC receptors in a panel of \\nhundreds of tumor and normal tissues, prioritizing peptides broadly \\nexpressed in tumors but not in normal tissues. These peptides are then \\nvalidated using expression analysis and confirmed to have minimal cross-\\nreactivity using bioinformatic analysis. ACET then creates antibodies \\ndirected to these antigens when bound to the MHC receptor, which can \\nthen be coded as CARs for use in a γδ T cell-based therapy.\\nIllustration of TCRL\\nGUGGENHEIM SECURITIES, LLC\\nPage 35\\nSee pages 45 - 46 for analyst certification and important disclosures.\\nFor the exclusive use of Jonathan Livescault (jlivescault@pwpartners.com) at Perella Weinberg Partners\\nACET has developed TCRLs against tyrosinase, a well validated tumor-\\nexpressed antigen\\nSource: Guggenheim Securities, LLC; ACET corporate presentation\\nACET has the ability to identify highly specific TCRL antibodies to selected antigen + MHC complexes. To \\ndevelop a TCRL against tyrosinase, ACET assessed the binding affinity of candidate TCRLs to a panel of peptides \\nthat each contained a single amino acid change. In doing so, ACET discovered that any change to the 8 internal \\namino acid positions could dramatically reduce binding affinity (e.g., 70%+ reductions). As such, it was able to \\nidentify key sequences that were necessary for highly specific binding to the desired antigen + MHC complex.\\nPreclinical data suggests potent anti-tumor response with Tyr γδ T cells.

(RXRX) with a Buy \\nrecommendation and price target of $37, implying 42% upside. RXRX’s \\nplatform enables the identification of potential drug candidate deficiencies \\nearly in the discovery process, maximizing cost efficiencies and the probability \\nof success. Its expansive proprietary database (~9 petabytes [PB] of imaging \\ndata) and integrated technologies drive its competitive advantage. RXRX has a \\nmix of both new chemical entities (NCEs) and repurposed known chemical \\nentities (KCEs) across different indications in its pipeline, and progresses each \\nprogram internally. Moreover, asset-backed collaborations have fueled RXRX’s \\nclinical pipeline, with four in-licensed potentially lucrative programs. \\n● RXRX’s platform enables the identification of potential drug candidate \\ndeficiencies early in the discovery process, maximizing cost efficiencies and \\nthe probability of clinical success. RXRX’s platform expands the funnel of \\nprospective therapeutic starting points to identify potential compound failures \\nearlier in the drug R&D cycle, thereby reducing probabilities of clinical failures. \\nReducing failures in the clinic increases R&D cost efficiencies and streamlines \\nthe process for novel therapeutics to reach the market more quickly.   \\n● Its expansive proprietary database and integrated technologies drive the \\ncompany’s competitive advantage. 9 PB of biological and chemical data \\ngenerated by Recursion’s OS platform are stored in the Recursion Data \\nUniverse. RXRX generates data through a wide set of methodologies, primarily \\nphenomics. RXRX’s platform and database deepen with each conducted \\nexperiment (~82m phenomic experiments as of Q2 21), which continuously \\nstrengthens its machine learning (ML) capabilities. RXRX has also layered \\ntechnologies throughout its platform, enabling a compounding stack of \\ndiscovery and development efficiencies. \\n● Asset-backed collaborations have fueled RXRX’s clinical pipeline with \\npotentially lucrative programs. RXRX’s four clinical programs are in-licensed \\nfor internal development via asset development partnerships. We believe each \\nof these four programs, which are repurposed KCEs, could provide lucrative \\nmarket opportunities as soon as 2024E. \\n● RXRX’s lack of commercialized therapeutics may deter investors; however, \\nwe believe its four clinical programs are significant tailwinds. Although RXRX \\nhas an early-stage pipeline with no approved drugs to date, all four of its clinical \\nprograms are set to begin Phase 2 trials in the next three to four quarters.  \\n● Valuation: We value RXRX on a 15-year risk adjusted DCF, which yields a price \\ntarget of $37. We only include contributions from the four clinical programs. \\nGal Munda, CFA \\nAnalyst \\n+1 646 949 9021 \\ngal.munda@berenberg-us.com \\nGaurav Goparaju \\nAssociate \\n+1 646 949 9024 \\ngaurav.goparaju@berenberg-us.com \\nZhiqiang Shu, PhD \\nAnalyst \\n+1 917 797 7610 \\nzhiqiang.shu@berenberg-us.com \\n \\nY/E 12/31, USD m \\n2019  \\n2020  \\n2021E \\n2022E \\n2023E \\nRevenues \\n2 \\n4 \\n11 \\n11 \\n11 \\nGeneral and administration \\n-19 \\n-25 \\n-53 \\n-64 \\n-67 \\nResearch and development \\n-46 \\n-63 \\n-117 \\n-158 \\n-174 \\nEBIT Reported \\n(62) \\n(85) \\n(160) \\n(211) \\n(230) \\nNet Profit \\n-62 \\n-87 \\n-162 \\n-214 \\n-233 \\nNet debt \\n-57 \\n-250 \\n-97 \\n113 \\n341 \\nEPS reported \\n-2.87 \\n-3.99 \\n-1.17 \\n-1.54 \\n-1.68 \\nROCE \\n-65.9% \\n-30.7% \\n-121.5% \\n279.2% \\n76.3% \\nEV / sales \\n217.9 \\n80.4 \\n332.7 \\n351.6 \\n372.8 \\nEV / EBITDA \\n-7.7 \\n-3.6 \\n-21.4 \\n-17.2 \\n-16.8 \\nEV / EBIT \\n-8.1 \\n-3.8 \\n-22.0 \\n-17.6 \\n-17.2 \\n \\nSource: Company data, BCM estimates \\n \\n \\nSeptember 21, 2021 \\nBUY \\n(Initiation) \\nCurrent price \\nPrice target \\nUSD 26.09 \\nUSD 37.00 \\n09/20/2021 NASDAQ Close \\nMarket cap (USD m) \\n3,610 \\nReuters \\nRXRX.O \\nBloomberg \\nRXRX US \\n \\n \\n \\nShare data \\nShares outstanding (m) \\n138.36 \\nEnterprise value (USD m) \\n3,513 \\nDaily trading volume \\n1,173,489 \\n \\n \\n \\nKey data \\nRevenues \\n11 \\nNet Profit \\n-162 \\nEPS reported \\n-1.17 \\nResearch and development \\n-117 \\n \\n \\nSource: FactSet \\n \\nFor the exclusive use of Jonathan Livescault (jlivescault@pwpartners.com) at Perella Weinberg Partners\\nRecursion Pharmaceuticals, Inc.

(RXRX) with a Buy recommendation and \\nprice target of $37, implying 42% potential upside. RXRX is a digital biology company that \\nleverages its proprietary drug discovery platform to enable more efficient drug development. Its \\nplatform, called Recursion OS, is driven by ML technology and a large proprietary database \\ngenerated from RXRX’s wet-lab biology. \\nRecursion OS is composed of three segments: \\n● Infrastructure Layer (core, data-generating layer of Recursion OS); \\n● Recursion Data Universe (RXRX’s database that holds nearly 9 PB of biological and chemical \\ndata as of Q2 2021); and \\n● Recursion Map (a suite of proprietary software, algorithms, and ML tools that interpret data \\nfrom the Recursion Data Universe for actionable insights). \\nRXRX utilizes in silico tools to analyze and interpret its data to help maximize the efficient discovery \\nof novel and re-purposed compounds to treat a broad range of targets and disease indications. Each \\nnew program conducted on its OS strengthens the platform and database, maximizing its ability for \\nfuture programs (either internal or collaborative). We note that RXRX has a pipeline of 48 programs, \\nof which four are in the clinic.  \\nKey investment point one: novel platform enables more efficient drug discovery \\nKey investment point two: proprietary database drives competitive moat \\nKey investment point three: pipeline reflects dynamic internal and collaborative business \\nmodel \\n \\nFor the exclusive use of Jonathan Livescault (jlivescault@pwpartners.com) at Perella Weinberg Partners\\nRecursion Pharmaceuticals, Inc.

We believe this is a critical \\ncompetitive advantage for RXRX.  \\nQuality, proprietary datasets are invaluable \\nData stored in the Recursion Data Universe is generated internally via an array of different data-\\ngenerating modalities, enabled by RXRX’s wet-lab. RXRX has put a lot of resources into building its \\nautomation (e.g., robotics) and workflow capabilities to be able to collect high quality and controlled \\nimage-based datasets suitable for its AI and ML methodologies.  \\nFeeding ML technology with quality data is critical to maximize the analysis and inferences for \\nscientists to gain better insights. Many companies in the space rely on publicly available \\ndatasets, or partner with institutions with large data pools (e.g., privately-held company, \\nnference, and the Mayo Clinic). These standard experimental datasets can limit the \\nperformance of neural technologies, and even produce unreliable analysis due to the lack of \\ncontrol and quality in the data. ML technology will largely always identify patterns in its \\nanalyzed datasets; however, if they are fed these standard datasets, inferences generated are \\nmore prone to batch-to-batch variations and other underlying effects.  \\nCross-functional team enables superior data generation and analysis \\nIn our view, what separates RXRX from the majority of its competitors is its ability to bring together \\na cross-functional team of specialists, such as data scientists, biologists, and ML experts, to work \\ncohesively in the experimental design, observation, and analysis of experiments and data. This \\ncreates a closed-loop of iterative understanding that does not exist at many AI-enabled drug \\ndiscovery companies that use publicly available data versus generating proprietary datasets.  \\nFor the exclusive use of Jonathan Livescault (jlivescault@pwpartners.com) at Perella Weinberg Partners\\nRecursion Pharmaceuticals, Inc.

This demonstrates RXRX’s innovative culture, as specialists from different backgrounds \\nare encouraged to work together rather than performing their tasks in respective isolation. RXRX \\nsought to build a company that brought all of these disciplines together and a model that is driven \\nby data science rather than conventional wisdom and traditional drug discovery. Accomplishing \\nthis is not easy or simple, as a company has to recruit personnel open to thinking in this non-\\ntraditional way in each respective department. We note that 35% of RXRX’s team comprises \\nsoftware engineers and data scientists. \\nTraditionally, drug discovery teams at pharmaceutical companies, which include biologists, \\nchemists, and bioinformatics groups, have a transactional relationship versus a partnership. For \\nexample, biologists and chemists in this culture would merely ask the bioinformatics group to run \\nstatistics on a data set they had generated, rather than working together to make more well-\\ninformed and dynamic inferences and analysis. This is a critical fundamental difference between \\ncompanies, like RXRX, building a novel platform from the ground up and an established \\npharmaceutical company seeking to place its various departments of specialists on equal footing. \\nFostering a culture that enables teams to work cohesively on a level playing field is not easy. \\nChallenging conventional drug discovery teams to evolve into this cross-functional, disruptive \\nmodel is difficult to navigate, and requires effort, proper leadership in place, and a culture that \\nencourages cross-department, partnership-based work. We believe that when executed properly, \\ndrug discovery capabilities are enhanced and are more likely to produce successful and novel \\ndatasets and drug candidates.  \\nBuilding a wet-lab data platform in drug discovery takes iteration and time (roughly two to three \\nyears). Because this process of adaptation and developing a clear vision cannot be accomplished \\novernight, even with open-minded personnel on board, it takes time for new companies in \\ntechnology-enabled drug discovery to establish themselves. We believe that RXRX has formed a \\nsizeable moat through its data-generating platform, in a space that has an influx of new players.  \\nRXRX leverages a diverse set of data generating modalities \\nThrough RXRX’s integrated wet-lab processes, it is able to source novel datasets from a variety of \\ndata generating modalities. Though RXRX primarily leverages phenomics-based approaches, which \\nstudy changes in cell morphology, the company utilizes Orthogonomics, bespoke assay data, \\nADMET assays, and InVivomics. According to management, advances in image processing and \\ncomputer vision have also enabled greater sophistication in RXRX’s data generation platform. Each \\nof these approaches are used by RXRX at various scales and provide different levels of translation, \\nas illustrated below.  \\nFor the exclusive use of Jonathan Livescault (jlivescault@pwpartners.com) at Perella Weinberg Partners\\nRecursion Pharmaceuticals, Inc.

As of December 2020, RXRX notes that it has the capacity to conduct up to 1.5m \\nexperiments weekly, producing over 9m images (80 TB of data). Seventeen integrated \\nmicroscopes (from ImageExpress) capture approximately 99,000 fluorescent images per hour \\nthrough six distinct imaging channels. The Recursion OS platform also stores and tracks meta-data \\nproduced by each experiment, leveraging its quality control (QC) systems to ensure the data is of \\nhigh quality prior to being funneled into the Recursion Data Universe. Meta-data is data that relates \\nto the execution of the experiment rather than the results they produce, which is valuable to ensure \\nconsistency in similarly conducted future experiments.  \\nThrough a partnership with NVIDIA initiated in December 2020, RXRX has integrated the world’s \\n58th most powerful supercomputer, titled BioHive-1, to further accelerate its drug discovery \\nplatform. BioHive-1 maximizes the speed and iteration of RXRX’s ML algorithms, and enables a \\nmore comprehensive sweep of RXRX’s expansive data universe from these neural network \\ntechnologies. By increasing its computing power, RXRX’s ML and AI models leave fewer “stones” \\nunturned, acting as a tailwind for RXRX to more efficiently identify more hits and attractive drug \\ncandidates early in the drug discovery process.  \\nWe also note that RXRX leverages both public and private cloud infrastructures, enabling a flexible \\nhybrid-cloud strategy. The public cloud is RXRX’s default infrastructure for applications and \\nworkloads, providing a cost efficient execution for RXRX through its favorable economies of scale \\nand elastic framework. According to management, RXRX’s private cloud infrastructure spares \\nbandwidth while augmenting speed and response times. The company leverages edge computing \\nvia uploads of its data to the public cloud, integrating its lab data workflows. Through its dynamic \\ncloud ecosystem, RXRX’s diverse cross-functional team can remotely collaborate with partners to \\nconduct and design both large and small experiments, while maintaining effective security of \\ninformation for both parties.  \\nRXRX also utilizes various experimental design tools for a variety of perturbations, including \\nchemical, genetic, and other biological perturbations. CRISPR, for example, is a tool that enables \\ngenetic perturbations through the editing of cells via gene knockdowns or gene knockoffs. RXRX \\nboasts a suite of proprietary, automated quality control and experiment execution software \\nsolutions as well, such as PlateWatch, Image Explorer, and its core Experiment Execution Command \\nCenter (EECC) tool.  \\nFor the exclusive use of Jonathan Livescault (jlivescault@pwpartners.com) at Perella Weinberg Partners\\nRecursion Pharmaceuticals, Inc.

Advanced robotics technology enables RXRX’s automated platform to thoroughly \\nconduct millions of experiments a week, generating an ever growing library of valuable image-\\nbased datasets (~9m images weekly). These cells, which are directly mimicking various disease \\nstates, are introduced to various compounds from RXRX’s data universe in an effort to capture any \\nresulting phenotypic changes from certain, executed perturbations.

Four of these programs, which are in-licensed via asset development partnerships, are \\nrepurposed KCEs; each of the four are in the clinic awaiting Phase 2 trials (management expect this \\nto come in the next three to four quarters). RXRX has four other programs in IND-enabling studies, \\nseven in the late discovery stage, while the rest are still in the early discovery phase.

In Q2 21, RXRX announced that its first \\ninternally developed NCE is advancing into IND-enabling studies as well, demonstrating RXRX’s \\nability to leverage its platform to both discover NCEs and repurpose KCEs to maintain a diverse \\nand expansive portfolio of programs.  \\nSince its inception, RXRX has expanded its internal development efforts, unlike its drug discovery \\nplatform competitors that tend to have partnership heavy pipelines, with few early stage internal \\nprograms, if any. We believe this is consistent with the company’s innovative culture and strategy, \\na carrying philosophy that encourages taking more risks while trusting the science and data to \\nadvance programs toward the clinic. In addition, its rationale for being internal program dominant \\nstems from its perception that potential partners could not be as nimble or bold as itself in drug \\ndiscovery and development processes. Regarding collaborations, we note that RXRX is \\nintentionally structured so that it is not a traditional CRO, biotech, or screening company but \\nrather a dedicated and value-adding pro-discovery company for potential partners.  \\nREC-4881: Familial Adenomatous Polyposis (FAP) \\nTargeting patients with FAP and APC-driven tumors, REC-4881 is a non-ATP-competitive allosteric \\nsmall molecule inhibitor of MEK1 And MEK2 that is orally bioavailable and a potentially first-in-\\nclass therapeutic (no approved therapeutics on the market target FAP). Approximately 50,000 \\npatients in the U.S. and European Union are affected by rare FAP driven tumors, which are derived \\nfrom APC gene mutations. These mutations foster tumor growth because the APC gene is critical in \\nmitigating tumor growth, and can develop into gastrointestinal (GI) cancers.  \\nIn May 2020, RXRX acquired the global license for REC-4881 from Takeda Pharmaceuticals. Given \\nthere are no therapeutics approved to date that effectively treat FAP-driven cancers, we believe \\nREC-4881 is a potentially lucrative first-in-class therapeutic that will be positioned as an attractive \\nalternative to the extended endoscopic monitoring required and colonoscopies that comprise the \\ncurrent standard of care (SOC) to this condition, such as colectomies (removal of the colon in any \\ncapacity). RXRX is looking for REC-4881 to capitalize on this highly unmet need in the market for \\nan effective, non-surgical therapy that treats FAP-driven cancers. RXRX notes potential competition \\nfrom four other therapeutics targeting colorectal polyposis reduction that are also in active clinical \\nstudies. However, these programs differ from REC-4481’s in that, based on favorable preclinical \\ndata, RXRX is optimistic its inhibitor can help patients with both benign polyps and dysplastic \\nadenomas.  \\nREC-4881 is currently awaiting Phase 2 trials to evaluate its PK, efficacy, and safety in classical FAP \\npatients; management expects the trials to commence in the next three to four quarters. Phase 2 \\ntrials will be double-blind, randomizing patients into one placebo group and two active groups, \\nwith the primary treatment period and extension period lasting 24 weeks each.  \\nExhibit 15: REC-4881 Phase 2 trial plan  \\n \\nSource: Company reports \\n \\nFor the exclusive use of Jonathan Livescault (jlivescault@pwpartners.com) at Perella Weinberg Partners\\nRecursion Pharmaceuticals, Inc.

This condition is extremely rare (U.S. and \\nEU patient prevalence of just 400 people) and stems from patients with genetic mutations in HEXA \\nor HEXB, also known as Tay-Sachs and Sandhoff Disease, respectively. REC-3599 may potentially \\nbe used in combination with gene therapy or as a monotherapy, each with the ability to slow \\nneurological decline in patients with GM2. GM2 is particularly lethal in infants, accelerating \\nneurological degeneration prior to death just a few years from birth. We note that RXRX received a \\npediatric rare disease designation for REC-3599 in GM2 in 2020. \\nThere are no currently approved therapeutics on the market that treat GM2, and existing treatments \\nare limited to supported feeding tubes, anti-seizure medications, ventilatory support, or percutaneous \\nendoscopic gastronomy, among other supportive measures. Because GM2 is a low patient prevalence \\ndisease that is lethal and largely impacts pediatric patients, it also marks a big, profitable opportunity \\nfor RXRX if it is able to commercialize a first-in-class and efficacious therapeutic. RXRX notes four \\ndifferent active clinical programs that may compete with REC-3599, with two being AAV-based gene \\ntherapies and two being small molecule substrate reduction therapies.  \\nREC-3599 is currently awaiting open-label Phase 2 trials while RXRX aggregates additional PD data \\nin an HEXB-mutated GM2 animal model, as requested by the FDA. We note that RXRX licensed the \\nrights to the compound from Chromaderm in December 2019, Chromaderm had previously licensed \\nthe compound from Eli Lilly in 2015. Eli Lilly was investigating the compound’s effect in patients \\nwith diabetic retinopathy. Management expects Phase 2 trials to begin in the next three to four \\nquarters. \\nExhibit 16: REC-3599 Phase 2 trial plan  \\n \\nSource: Company reports \\nREC-2282: Neurofibromatosis type 2 (NF2) and NF2-driven meningiomas \\nFunctioning as a differentiated small molecule HDAC inhibitor REC-2282 is a CNS-penetrant \\ntherapeutic candidate that is intended to treat NF2-driven meningioma and neurofibromatosis type \\n2 (NF2). It is unique to other approved HDAC inhibitors, which we note have been used in neurology \\nand investigational cancer therapies, due to its more favorable toxicity profile, it being CNS-\\npenetrant and orally bioavailable. RXRX notes three current competitor programs targeting NF2-\\ndriven brain tumors (meningiomas) that are currently in clinical development. One is an ALK \\ninhibitor from Takeda, one is an ALK/ROS1 inhibitor from an investigator sponsored study, and \\none is an MEK inhibitor from AstraZeneca. Unlike its competitors, which are single pathway \\ninhibitors of MEK or ALK, REC-2282 is capable of inhibiting the activation of multiple abnormal \\npathways simultaneously. We note that the annual incidence for patients with NF2-driven \\nmeningiomas in the U.S. and EU combined is 33k. \\nREC-2282 is currently awaiting a two stage, parallel group, Phase 2/3, randomized, multicenter \\nstudy that management expects to commence in the next three to four quarters.  \\nFor the exclusive use of Jonathan Livescault (jlivescault@pwpartners.com) at Perella Weinberg Partners\\nRecursion Pharmaceuticals, Inc.

CCM is a rare disease with a large unmet need and no currently \\napproved therapeutics in the market, with the only SOC methods being invasive surgical \\ninterventions. Over 360k symptomatic patients have CCM in the U.S. and EU. There are two notable \\ntherapeutic competitors addressing CCM, each currently undergoing clinical studies. These two \\ncompetitor programs are investigator-initiated studies ran by the University of Chicago and the \\nMario Negri Institute for Pharmacological Research, respectively. The REC-994 program is the only \\ncurrent industry sponsored therapeutic program targeting CCM, which means REC-994 is the first \\ntargeted treatment for this condition.  \\nREC-994 is currently awaiting Phase 2 trials; management expects it to commence trials in the next \\nthree to four quarters. Its Phase 2 trial will be conducted as a double-blind, placebo-controlled, \\nsafety tolerability, and exploratory efficacy study.  \\nExhibit 18: REC-994 Phase 2 trial plan  \\n \\nSource: Company reports \\nNotable preclinical and late discovery programs  \\nClostridium Difficile Colitis (CDI): infectious disease \\nRXRX has selected REC-3964 as its lead small-molecule candidate to treat CDI. CDI is an infectious \\ndisease that causes severe inflammation of the colon and is caused by the disruption of healthy \\nbacteria in the colon, specifically from the bacteria C. difficile. Although the use of antibiotics may \\nenable CDI development, current treatments are antibiotics that specifically target C. difficile. CDI \\ncan result in severe diarrhea and sometimes death. The annual incidence of CDI is approximately \\n730k in the U.S. and EU combined.  \\nREC-3964 is RXRX’s first internally developed NCE to enter IND-enabling studies. It is an orally \\nactive, gut biased, inhibitor of C. difficile toxin B. RXRX also plans to leverage REC-3964 as an \\nancillary prophylactic treatment in patients with high CDI risk and to prevent recurrent disease.  \\nFor the exclusive use of Jonathan Livescault (jlivescault@pwpartners.com) at Perella Weinberg Partners\\nRecursion Pharmaceuticals, Inc.

Physicians commonly look to identify mutations in STK11 a biomarker in non-small \\ncell lung cancer (NSCLC). There are currently no approved treatments on the market that modify \\ntumor response in STK11-mutant cancers. STK11-mutant metastatic NSCLC has an annual \\ncombined incidence of 30k in the U.S. and EU. STK11-mutant NSCLC has exhibited resistance to \\nimmune checkpoint inhibitors, creating high unmet need for a new therapeutic for patients with \\nthis disease. \\nRXRX’s lead molecule is currently undergoing preclinical studies and has recently completed dose \\noptimization studies for its selected lead candidate, REC-64151. The lead compound has now \\nprogressed to PD studies in rodent NSCLC models of STK11-mediated checkpoint resistance. It is a \\npotential orally bioavailable, small molecule therapeutic that aims to re-establish and increase \\nsensitivity to immune checkpoint inhibitors in tumors with STK11 mutations. \\nCancer immunotherapy, target ‘alpha’ \\nRXRX is developing a small molecule NCE inhibitor of undisclosed target ‘alpha’ that is currently in \\nthe late discovery stage. Target ‘alpha’ was determined based on its relationship strength to known \\ngenes that affect immunotherapy response. When inhibited by a small molecule compound alone \\nand in conjunction with anti-PD1 in a CT26 model of immune checkpoint resistance, target ‘alpha’ \\nexpressed robust activity and achieved 40% total response in the combination therapy.  \\nNeuroinflammation \\nRXRX has identified three lead, small molecule NCE compounds (REC-648455, REC-648597, and \\nREC-648677) that are possibly orally active, gut-biased, and CNS-penetrant modulators of \\nmicroglial activation for the treatment of neuroinflammation. Prevalent neurodegenerative \\ndiseases (i.e., Parkinson’s and Alzheimer’s) and CNS inflammatory diseases (i.e., multiple sclerosis) \\nare tied to microglial activation and neuroinflammation, and RXRX’s small molecule modulators of \\nmicroglial activation aim to reduce neuronal death associated with the aforementioned indications. \\nThere is a prevalence of 13m patients in the U.S. and EU suffering from a variety of indications \\nwithin neuroinflammation, including multiple neurodegenerative diseases. \\nThe company notes that its lead compounds have exhibited attenuated anti-inflammatory cytokine \\nresponses in a mouse PD model of neuroinflammation.  \\nOncology – MYC inhibitors \\nMYC is a protein coding gene that regulates multiple cell functions, such as cell growth, apoptosis, \\ncellular metabolism, and the cell cycle. RXRX is developing small molecule MYC-inhibitors for \\npatients with solid and hematological malignancies. Increased expression of the MYC gene, \\nparticularly in the transcriptional activity downstream of MYC, has been found in up to 50% of all \\ncancers. Annually, there are 130k patients in the U.S. and EU with indications driven by MYC \\nalterations. \\nRXRX’s MYC inhibitory molecules are currently in the late discovery stage and undergoing \\noptimization. The company notes that there is evidence of structure activity relationship (SAR) \\nthrough the expansion of multiple hit series from digital chemistry tools. RXRX has not finalized a \\ntarget product profile for a specific indication; however, this program may be able to address many \\nMYC-alteration driven indications. \\nBatten Disease: rare disease \\nBatten disease is rare and fatal genetic disease in the nervous system (a neurodegenerative disease) \\nwith a high-unmet need. This inherited gene defect causes a string of issues that inhibits the ability \\nof cells to recycle specific molecules. CLN is the specific gene mutated that causes Batten disease, \\nand the disease can arise when any of the 14 CLN genes are altered. There are no existing treatments \\nthat can reverse Batten disease symptoms; however, the FDA approved an enzyme replacement \\ntherapy in 2017 that can stop or reduce the progression of symptoms in the CLN2 sub-type of Batten \\ndisease.

Batten disease has a prevalence of approximately 2k people in the \\nU.S. and EU and is the most common pediatric neurogenerative disease. \\nCurrently in the late discovery stage, RXRX has identified three lead NCE candidates (REC-648190, \\nREC-259618, and REC-648647) that are being evaluated in rodent PD models of Batten disease. \\nThese lead compounds are possible orally bioavailable, CNS-penetrant, and disease modifying \\ntherapeutics that aim to target many sub-forms of Batten disease.  \\nCharcot-Marie-Tooth type 2A (CMT2A): rare disease \\nCMT2A is a rare, inherited nerve degenerative disease that is caused by mutations in the MFN2 gene. \\nAlterations of the MFN2 gene cause problems within the nerves that carry electrical signals to and \\nfrom the body and CNS (called axons). Symptoms are largely developed at a young age, and patients \\nwith CMT2A can experience escalating muscle atrophy in their limbs, particularly in their hands \\nand lower legs. There are no current treatments that cure CMT2A, with existing therapies being \\nlimited to physical and occupational therapy. CMT2A has a prevalence of approximately 15k people \\nin the U.S. and EU. \\nCurrently in the late discovery stage, RXRX has identified four lead NCE candidates (REC-64810, \\nREC-648458, REC-1262, and REC-150357) that are possible orally bioavailable and disease \\nmodifying compounds aimed to slow or reverse the advancement of CMT2A symptoms. RXRX is \\nassessing small molecule mechanistic classes in a rodent model of CMT2A. \\nCollaborative pipeline bolstered by diverse partnership strategies \\nWhile RXRX largely relies on and invests in its internal pipeline, its most advanced candidates stem \\nfrom one of its collaborative drug discovery and development strategies. RXRX forms partnerships \\nthrough two mediums, either through discovery platform partnerships (a traditional drug discovery \\nand development partnership structure enabling downstream payments to RXRX) or asset \\ndevelopment partnerships, the latter of which was leveraged to in-license its four lead programs for \\ninternal development. Major partnership deals include collaborations with Bayer and Sanofi.  \\nFor the exclusive use of Jonathan Livescault (jlivescault@pwpartners.com) at Perella Weinberg Partners\\nRecursion Pharmaceuticals, Inc.

We identify the present value of its internal programs as the sole \\ndriver of our price target of $37 as RXRX does not generate revenues from other sources (e.g., \\nservices).  \\n● Four programs are in the clinic, four are in preclinical studies, seven are in late discovery, and \\n33 are unidentified in early discovery. RXRX’s pipeline largely targets rare genetic diseases in \\npediatric patients (a patient population with large unmet need) but also has exposure to other \\nareas such as oncology, neuroinflammation, and CNS.  \\n● Each of the four programs in the clinic entered RXRX’s pipeline via asset development \\npartnerships and are repurposed KCEs. Therefore, our PoS assumptions are higher than that \\nof NCEs due to their more known and proven safety profiles.  \\nOverview of key value drivers \\nWe first reiterate that RXRX drives revenue entirely from its pipeline assets, none of which have \\nbeen commercialized or have reached Phase 3 studies. Critical to RXRX’s future and its near-term \\nsuccess is the progression of its four wholly-owned programs that are each in simultaneous stages \\nwithin the clinic. Because RXRX does not have any PoC products that have reached the market to \\ndate, the commercialization of these four programs is extremely important to help validate RXRX’s \\nplatform, drive investor confidence in the rest of RXRX’s pipeline, and generate more high-value \\nprogram collaborations with other pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies.  \\nWe note that, for each of the disease indications targeted in the clinic, there are no approved \\ntherapeutics on the market. The majority of current treatment lies in surgical intervention (after \\nsome patients may endure new persistent complications that require frequent monitoring by \\nmedical professionals. However, there are also competing therapeutics for the same indications \\ncurrently in the clinic via competitors. This influences our peak market penetration assumption as \\nthe entrance of commercialized, competing therapeutics may risk taking market share from RXRX. \\nWe also note that each of these therapeutics are chronic treatments and not one-time curative \\ntherapies (therefore slightly cheaper though still expensive).  \\nDue to the lack of material pipeline PoCs (early-stage pipeline) we do not include estimates for \\nRXRX’s preclinical or late discovery programs. We note that this creates significant upside potential \\nto our estimates if they materialize. Notable late stage, non-clinical programs include RXRX’s \\nImmune Checkpoint Resistance Program (KCE, Oncology, Preclinical) C. Difficile Colitis program \\n(NCE, IBD, preclinical), pulmonary Arterial Hypertension program (KCE, Rare Disease, preclinical), \\nMYC Inhibitor program in Oncology (NCE, Oncology, late discovery), Batten Disease (NCE, Rare \\nDisease, late discovery), and CMT2A program (NCE, Rare Disease, late discovery). \\nExhibit 20: Clinical revenue buildup  \\n \\nSource: BCM estimates \\nRare Disease implications \\nBecause the majority of RXRX’s clinical programs target Rare Disease, specifically pediatric Rare \\nDiseases with small patient prevalence and no currently approved therapeutics, we assume \\npremium pricing in our models.

We believe this partnership acts as an early indicator in validating RXRX’s platform. \\nRXRX received a $30m upfront technology access fee from Bayer of which it amortizes linearly each \\nquarter over the span of the deal as non-cash revenue ($2.5m per quarter) under operating revenue. \\nBayer is also entitled to ~$1bn in downstream milestones over the course of the partnership, \\namounting to ~$100m per program. RXRX is entitled to mid-tiered royalties upon any of these \\nproducts reaching the market as well. As a conservative measure due to RXRX’s early-stage platform \\nwith little material PoC, we do not include cash revenues from the Bayer deal, implying there could \\nbe significant potential upside to our estimates if the downstream payments materialize for RXRX. \\nPhase I - Approval LoA\\n17.0%\\nPhase II - Approval LoA\\n25.2%\\nPhase III - Approval LoA\\n56.6%\\nNDA - Approval LoA\\n93.6%\\nPhase I - Phase II PoS\\n67.4%\\nPhase II - Phase III PoS\\n44.6%\\nPhase III - NDA PoS\\n60.4%\\nNDA-Approval\\n93.6%\\nRare Disease Assumptions\\nPhase I - Approval LoA\\n5.3%\\nPhase II - Approval LoA\\n10.8%\\nPhase III - Approval LoA\\n43.9%\\nNDA - Approval LoA\\n92.0%\\nPhase I - Phase II PoS\\n48.8%\\nPhase II - Phase III PoS\\n24.6%\\nPhase III - NDA PoS\\n47.7%\\nNDA - Approval LOA\\n92.0%\\nOncology Assumptions\\nPhase I - Approval LoA\\n13.3%\\nPhase II - Approval LoA\\n23.2%\\nPhase III - Approval LoA\\n61.8%\\nNDA - Approval LoA\\n91.5%\\nPhase I - Approval PoS\\n22.6%\\nPhase I - Phase II PoS\\n57.5%\\nPhase II - Phase III PoS\\n37.5%\\nNDA - Approval PoS\\n91.5%\\nNon-NME Assumptions\\nFor the exclusive use of Jonathan Livescault (jlivescault@pwpartners.com) at Perella Weinberg Partners\\nRecursion Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (RXRX US) \\nHealthcare Technology \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n31 \\nCost drivers \\nWe model a large R&D and G&A ramp up for FY21 as a result of RXRX investing in the expertise and \\ninfrastructure to simultaneously put all four of its lead candidates through the clinic (Phase 2/3) \\nindependently, and for the first time in the company’s short history. Beyond FY21, our estimates plateau \\ninto modest operating expense growth; however, we expect another ramp in costs when the next four \\nprograms, which are currently in preclinical studies, are ready to progress into the clinic. We believe this \\nwill likely warrant an even greater step-up in operating expenses at that time, as two of the four \\nprograms are NCE compounds, unlike the current clinical candidates, which are all KCEs. \\nArriving at our $37 price target \\nExhibit 28: DCF \\n \\nSource: BCM estimates \\nWe value RXRX on a 15-year DCF using a WACC of 13.3% and a long-term growth rate of 4% to get \\nour price target of $37, which implies potential upside of 42% from RXRX’s current price. Our base-\\ncase valuation expects each of the four clinical programs to progress into commercialization on time \\nand ultimately achieve our assumed market peak percent per program. Our model assumes FCF \\nbreakeven in 2026 on the back of its lead candidates reaching the market, beginning with REC-3599 \\nin in 2024.  \\nBull-case scenario \\nOur bull-case scenario expects each of the four clinical programs to commercialize as expected and \\nto exceed our assumed addressable patient population as well as maintain a longer period of time \\nunder our peak market assumption percent (as a result of clinical failures from potential \\ncompetitors in other pipelines).

RXRX has primarily generated non-cash revenue thus far in 2021 (amortized \\nupfront fee from Bayer is $2.5m a quarter). \\nCompetition: As more companies enter the space with competing services and technologies, there \\nis no guarantee that RXRX will secure future partnerships with pharma or biotech companies. Many \\nprograms in its pipeline also face opposition from competing pipelines. \\nToo early for any PoC: Since RXRX is still in its early stages and has no commercialized drugs to \\ndate, there is no certainty that any programs in its pipeline will reach the market and provide \\nrevenues for the company. Four programs are in clinical trials to date. \\nHesitation of widespread AI adoption in the industry: While the benefits of AI-enabled drug \\ndiscovery are apparent, pushback by the industry in resisting AI integration, due to ethical concerns \\nfor example, presents a risk for smart tech-enabled companies in the space.  \\nCOVID-19: The economic risk posed by the COVID-19 pandemic is biological rather than financial \\nin nature. It is therefore unprecedented in recent history. While vaccines appear to offer an effective \\nmeans of controlling the disease, the proportion of vaccinated individuals varies considerably by \\nnation and also within countries. The evolution and spread of more resistant variants of the virus \\ncontinue to hamper a full reopening of the global economy and pose an unquantifiable future risk \\nin the event more vaccine-resistant strains evolve. Consequently, there is still potential for further \\ndisruption to the economy from rolling lockdowns and other precautionary measures that are \\npossible in the event of flare-ups. Upside risk comes from the potential discovery of an effective \\nvaccine; however, evidence does presently suggest the mutability of the virus may prevent a single \\ncure (similar to the flu or the common cold) and the 100% uptake of any combination of vaccines \\nalso cannot be assumed, given reluctance from some quarters.

(RXRX US) \\nHealthcare Technology \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n33 \\nCompany overview  \\nWhat does Recursion Pharmaceuticals do? \\nRecursion Pharmaceuticals is a Salt Lake City, UT based digital biology company that leverages its \\nproprietary platform, in-house generated imaging datasets, and a dynamic, cohesive team of \\nexperts to make drug discovery more efficient. The company manages a diverse pipeline of 48 \\nprograms, both internal and collaborative based. Its platform, Recursion OS, enables RXRX to \\nproduce image-based data for empirical, phenotypic analysis that is analyzed by its ML and artificial \\nintelligence (AI) integration. Within the technology-enabled drug discovery space, RXRX’s vast, \\ninternally developed data base and ability to efficiently translate this data at scale to progress \\nprograms is a significant competitive moat. \\nWhile traditionally drug discovery has been conducted through target-based approaches, which \\ntend to span several years and can be influenced by researcher bias, RXRX has developed a \\nphenotypic approach that broadens the scope of molecules screened and analyzed. We believe this \\napproach is more cost and time efficient, as it enables a greater likelihood of identifying failures in \\npotential candidates earlier in the discovery process. RXRX’s platform is capable of both \\nrepurposing KCEs as well as discovering new chemical entities (NCEs) for development against \\nvarious targets. \\nRXRX’s manages a pipeline of both internal and collaborative drug programs. Highly differentiated \\nfrom companies in this space, RXRX’s pipeline predominantly comprises internal programs (only \\nsix total programs are collaborative based). Four of its programs are in the clinic and awaiting Phase \\n2 trials. We note that these programs entered the pipeline via asset development partnerships (in-\\nlicensed). RXRX’s pipeline is its only source of revenue, as the company does not offer any other \\nproducts or services. Revenues can be downstream payments to RXRX through its collaborative \\nprograms (royalties if commercialized and various milestones through development) or through \\nsales of its internal drug candidates if they reach the market. RXRX has not discovered or developed \\nany approved drugs to date. \\nCompetitive landscape \\nAll of RXRX’s direct competitors are currently private; we outline the most notable below. Each of \\nthe following companies leverage and boldly advertise their AI and ML capabilities in conjunction \\nwith high-throughput screening capacity as being instrumental in each respective approach to \\nmaximizing the efficiency of drug discovery. \\nInsitro: Insitro, a private data-driven drug discovery company founded in 2018 by Daphne Koller, \\nleverages high-throughput phenotypic screening with ML capabilities to identify new targets for \\nthe purpose of discovering and developing novel therapeutics, similar to RXRX. Through the \\nenablement of its tech stack, Insitro is able to generate functional genomic data sets with the intent \\nof aligning them with various patient data (via ML). As a result, the company is able to construct \\npredictive models that maximize the efficiency and speed of target selection and ultimately the \\ndesign of new therapeutics. Insitro has validated its platform through high profile collaborations \\nwith blue-chip pharmaceutical companies, including Gilead (NASH) and Bristol Myers Squibb (ALS). \\nWe note that in October 2022 Insitro acquired Haystack Sciences, a high-throughput chemistry \\nplatform that enables molecular design powered by ML.  \\nTo date, Insitro has received over ~$740m in funding with its most recent round being a $400m \\nSeries C raise in March 2021. According to management, these funds will be utilized toward \\nbolstering the Insitro’s pipeline and platform development. The company has 19 cumulative \\ninvestors, most notably BlackRock and Alexandria Venture Investments. \\nAtomwise: Atomwise is a private technology-enabled drug discovery company that leverages AI \\nsystems, a large and efficient computing power, and deep learning algorithms to enable and power \\nstructure-based small molecule drug discovery. The company’s customer base is vast, spanning \\nglobal pharma and agrochemical companies, as well as over 200 universities and hospitals in over \\n40 countries. Its solutions enable extremely accurate predictive models of small molecule binding \\nFor the exclusive use of Jonathan Livescault (jlivescault@pwpartners.com) at Perella Weinberg Partners\\nRecursion Pharmaceuticals, Inc.

Atomwise has worked with industry leaders such as Eli Lilly and Bayer. \\nTo date, Atomwise has received over ~$176m in funding with its most recent rounds being a $2m \\ngrant from the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation in October 2020, preceding an August 2020 $123m \\nSeries B round of fund raising. The company has 22 cumulative investors, most notably Tencent \\nand the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation. \\nAria Pharmaceuticals: Aria is an AI-driven, preclinical-stage pharmaceutical company that \\ndiscovers and develops novel small-molecule based therapies for difficult and complex targets \\nthrough computational methods. Founded in 2014, and previously named TwoXar, Aria claims its \\nsuccess rates in drug discovery are 30x greater than with traditional methods. Aria’s platform \\ntruncates the time from efficacy predictions to lead discovery to just zero to six months vs. four \\nyears using traditional methods. Its pipeline consists of over a dozen programs that span an array \\nof therapeutic areas, including Fibrosis, Immunology, Oncology and Glaucoma. Aria claims its \\nplatform is capable of enabling its reach to over 1,000 complex diseases. We note that its pipeline is \\ncomposed of both internal and collaborative programs, with the majority currently in late \\npreclinical studies. Similar to RXRX, its pipeline has mainly internal programs. \\nTo date, Aria has received over ~$14m in funding with its most recent round being a $10m Series A \\nraise in March 2018. The company has five cumulative investors, most notably Softbank Ventures \\nAsia and Andreessen Horowitz. \\nBenevolentAI: Founded in 2013, Benevolent AI is a London-based developer of AI and \\ncomputational medicine technologies leveraged alongside data-driven target identification to help \\nsolve complex disease biology in order to generate novel insights and discover sought after \\ntherapeutics. Its computational R&D platform (The Benevolent Platform) helps bolster its greater \\nthan 25 program pipeline that spans new chemical entity programs and repurposed entity drug \\ncandidates. Its pipeline spans various indications, such as Oncology, Immunology, Neurology, and \\nMetabolic disorders. The company has been involved in partnerships with blue-chip \\npharmaceutical organizations, such as with AstraZeneca (two programs, Chronic Kidney Disease \\nand IPF). BenevolentAI’s most advanced program targets Atopic Dermatitis, it is internal and \\ncurrently in Phase 1 studies  \\nTo date, BenevolentAI has received over ~292m in funding with its most recent round being a $90m \\nPrivate Equity offering in September 2019. The company has six cumulative investors, most notably \\nTemasek Holdings and Goldman Sachs. \\nInsilico Medicine: Based in Hong Kong and founded in 2014, Insilico Medicine developed an AI \\nplatform to accelerate drug discovery and development in therapeutics that treat age-related \\ndiseases (including Parkinson’s, Alzheimer’s) and cancer amongst others. Its suite of solutions, \\ncalled Pharma.AI, focuses on improving three major areas: 1) disease target identification \\n(PandaOmics), 2) generating data from novel molecules (Chemistry42), and 3) predicting clinical \\ntrial outcomes (InClinico). Insilico also has both an internal and collaborative pipeline of programs, \\nhaving signed recent partnership deals with Teva and Westlake Pharma. \\nTo date, Insilico has received over ~$306m in funding with its most recent round being a $255m \\nSeries C offering in June 2021. The company has 27 cumulative investors, most notably B.

(RXRX US) \\nHealthcare Technology \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n35 \\nSmart tech, smarter R&D; disrupting drug discovery \\n● Traditional drug discovery and development has historically faced three critical headwinds: \\n1) high costs, 2) long timelines, and 3) high failure rates. Recent industry adoption and \\nacceptance of disruptive digital solutions to these problems, such as artificial intelligence (AI) \\nand automation, are maximizing drug development R&D productivity by shortening timelines \\nand generating lower costs and higher probabilities of success. We believe RXRX is a contributor \\nto redefining the drug discovery space. \\n● Large biopharma and pharmaceutical companies are now relying on the technologies and \\nscientific acumen of smaller, specialized companies in order to maximize R&D productivity \\nand alleviate struggling ROIs. In addition to benefiting from downstream payments (i.e., \\nmilestones and royalties) through collaborations, many of these specialized companies have \\ngarnered the resources and capital to build internal drug pipelines. Internal, wholly owned drug \\nprograms maximize commercial opportunities without the need for financial or clinical support \\nfrom a larger biopharma partner. \\n● Continued advances in technology and scientific understanding enable the development of \\ncomplex drug modalities against a variety of difficult targets and indications. Over time, \\ntechnologies such as AI, computational power, and imaging are advancing in processing \\ncapacity, sophistication, and accuracy. As these technologies develop, their applications become \\nincreasingly effective and dynamic, especially within drug discovery. This progression has \\nenabled the development of more advanced drug modalities such as biologics (e.g., monoclonal \\nantibodies and cell-based therapies) as well as greater opportunities to discover and attack \\npreviously difficult targets (e.g., G protein-coupled receptors [GPCRs] and Ion channels).  \\n● The entire drug development cycle requires smart tech intervention to lower costs, limit \\nclinical failures, and help bring new therapeutics to market faster. Smart tech has started \\nenabling greater drug discovery efficiency through methods such as high-throughput screening \\nand the analysis of large, heterogenous datasets to identify and interpret hidden patterns. AI-\\nenabled drug discovery can also help scientists better predict optimal properties for potential \\ndrug candidates to help reduce developmental failure rates.  \\n● We believe the COVID-19 pandemic has raised investor awareness and interest in the tech-\\nenabled drug discovery and development space. The recent pandemic environment has put a \\nmagnifying glass on drug discovery and development, while also producing a surge in the IPOs \\nof specialized drug discovery technology companies. We note that RXRX went public this year. \\nThe COVID-19 pandemic era has accelerated the need for new, cost-efficient solutions to \\nstreamline novel drugs to market. We believe this is a critical tailwind for RXRX, and will \\nfacilitate greater technological innovation and adoption across the drug discovery and \\ndevelopment industry. \\n● Given this space is in its early stages, we believe investors are overlooking the long term-value \\nthat these comprehensive pipelines and platforms will provide. Although some near-term \\nheadwinds are critical, such as clinical failures, they are largely not reflective of the \\ncomprehensive platform value. Many names in the industry also have early-stage pipelines, and \\naccordingly have little to no PoC. Continued progression of pipeline programs, new and \\nexpanded partnership agreements, and high-profile publications are among key indicators of \\nplatform validation and PoC for RXRX. \\n \\n \\n \\n \\nFor the exclusive use of Jonathan Livescault (jlivescault@pwpartners.com) at Perella Weinberg Partners\\nRecursion Pharmaceuticals, Inc.

RXRX leverages its technology and platform to maximize efficient drug discovery and \\ndevelopment at reduced costs, shorter timelines, and with higher probabilities of success versus \\ntraditional methods. We believe RXRX will benefit greatly from recent investor interest in smaller, \\nmore specialized drug discovery-enabling companies with proprietary technology and scientific \\nexpertise. RXRX now joins AbCellera Biologics (ABCL) to bring our total specialty tech names under \\ncoverage to two. We note that our lead biotechnology analyst Zhiqiang Shu and his team recently \\npublished a deep dive into AI’s role in the convergence of biopharma and technology.  \\nExhibit 29: Berenberg Capital Markets specialty tech space \\n \\nSource: BCM estimates \\nRecursion Pharmaceuticals  \\nRXRX is a digital biology company that leverages its proprietary drug discovery platform to enable \\nmore efficient drug development. Its platform, Recursion OS, is driven by ML technology and a large \\nproprietary database generated from the company’s wet-lab biology. Recursion OS is composed of three \\nsegments: 1) The Infrastructure Layer, which is the core, data-generating layer of Recursion OS that is \\nbuilt on disruptive technologies such as Recursion’s world-class ML supercomputer, BioHive-1 (58th most \\nadvanced supercomputer available); 2) Recursion Data Universe, RXRX’s database that holds nearly 9 \\nPB of biological and chemical data as of Q2 2021; and 3) Recursion Map, a suite of proprietary software, \\nalgorithms, and ML tools that interpret data from the Recursion Data Universe for actionable insights. \\nRXRX utilizes in silico tools to analyze and interpret its data to help maximize the efficient discovery of \\nnovel and repurposed compounds to treat a broad range of targets and disease indications. Each new \\nprogram conducted on its OS strengthens the platform and database, maximizing its ability to conduct \\nfuture programs (either internal or collaborative). We note that RXRX has a pipeline of 48 programs, four \\nof which are in the clinic.  \\nRecursion Pharmaceuticals versus AbCellera Biologics \\nRXRX competes primarily with companies that discover, develop, and commercialize novel small \\nmolecule-based therapeutics via non-traditional processes, specifically leveraging disruptive, \\ntechnology-enabled drug discovery platforms.  \\nAbCellera Biologics: Although RXRX has discussed the possibility of expanding into discovering and \\ndeveloping biologics, its expansive internal and collaborative portfolio of 48 drug programs entirely \\ncomprised of small-molecule based therapeutic compounds. ABCL’s pipeline, however, is entirely \\nantibody therapeutics-based. ABCL’s business model is comparable to a traditional, fully-integrated \\nCRO, whereas RXRX’s business model is more in line with a clinical-stage biotech company that is \\ntransitioning into a drug discovery platform. Unlike RXRX, whose pipeline is a combination of internal \\nand collaborative programs, ABCL does not manage an internal pipeline; however, we note that the \\neconomics of the companies’ respective collaborative pipelines are similar, each typically receiving an \\nupfront research payment while also being entitled to various downstream payments in the form of \\nmilestones and royalties upon successful commercialization of the drug in question. Although RXRX and \\nABCL have similarities, the two are not direct competitors. \\n \\nCompanies\\nTicker Market Cap ($m)\\nRating\\nPT\\nImplied Upside\\nProduct Mix\\nPrimary Area of Focus\\nRecursion Pharmaceuticals\\nRXRX\\n$3,798\\nBUY\\n$37\\n38%\\n Internal/Collaborative \\nDrug Pipeline\\nSmall molecule-based drugs\\nAbCellera Biologics\\nABCL\\n$5,357\\nBUY\\n$48\\n83%\\n CRO Services\\nAntibody Discovery & \\nDevelopment \\nFor the exclusive use of Jonathan Livescault (jlivescault@pwpartners.com) at Perella Weinberg Partners\\nRecursion Pharmaceuticals, Inc.

Regarding RXRX’s competitive \\nmoat, our primary research indicates that the company’s in-house built datasets as a critical factor, as it \\nhas put a lot of effort into building its robotics and workflows to collect high quality and highly controlled \\ndatasets that are suitable for AI approaches. This quality cleaning process ensures that there are no batch \\nto batch variations in the data and that all insights from AI systems are accurate and controlled.  \\nOur expert also highlighted RXRX’s deliberate focus on developing and integrating a cross-functional \\nteam of specialists, which is critical for AI enabled drug discovery companies. For example, RXRX’s ability \\nto have data and ML scientists involved in the experimental design, observation, and analysis processes \\ncreates a loop that is different from companies in the space. This is not easy and requires immense effort \\nto accomplish and it requires both a management team that treats each team equally and cohesively, and \\npersonnel that are on-board and eager to work together. Our primary research reiterated that everyone \\nat RXRX is committed to challenging the status quo of conventional drug discovery; as a result, the \\ncompany has created a unilateral environment of innovation.  \\nOur primary research also discovered that RXRX’s platform impressively maintains efficient automation \\nand mass scalability while being incredibly inexpensive (microscopy is inherently scalable and cheap) \\nversus that of competitors. This is not easily replicated, however, as data sets are difficult to effectively \\ntap into due to the need to accurately interpret the produced images. RXRX has the required and \\ndifferentiating expertise in computer vision and image analysis to effectively translate these images \\ninto actionable insights through ML algorithms to enable novel therapeutic discovery and development. \\nRegarding limitations, our expert noted that, for the size of the company, it has a very aggressive strategy, \\nwith 48 programs in its pipeline (its first program was launched just three years ago). However, our \\nprimary research cites this aggression and ability to take risks as reflective of RXRX’s culture in pushing \\nthe boundaries of traditional drug discovery. Our expert notes that pharma companies usually will not \\nact purely on datasets and insights being generated by AI; however, RXRX’s philosophy is to trust the \\nscience, data, and novel insights from AI to progress candidates (while maintaining safety standards) \\ninstead of waiting for traditional datasets to confirm a compound is active, for example.  \\nFormer business development leader at RXRX \\nOur second RXRX focused primary expert has broad biopharma executive experience across all stages of \\ndrug discovery and development. RXRX’s focus from the beginning was to create an entirely propriety \\ndata set that was specifically designed for use in training sets for ML architecture, according to our expert. \\nOur primary research indicated that companies in the space that make this investment on bespoke data \\nsets fit for this use, like RXRX, will ultimately succeed versus companies that simply scrape public and \\npatented databases that are not designed to power ML architecture.  \\nWhile other companies implemented a genomics approach, biochemical assay approach, or target-\\ncentric approach, RXRX leveraged a phenotypic screening approach that was not popular at the time, \\nwhich gave the company a unique value proposition (there was a shift toward target-centric \\napproaches; however, phenotypic approaches are becoming accepted again). Our expert believes RXRX \\nis the best in the space at phenotypic screening due to its platform’s ability to rapidly generate massive \\namounts of imaging data while having the infrastructure in place to efficiently analyze it and act on the \\nactionable insights produced. Our primary research reiterates the sentiment that traditional biopharma \\npersonnel tend to be risk averse and checklist focused; RXRX has built a team and culture that effectively \\nblends different specialists and personalities in an effort to ultimately discover novel drugs.  \\nRegarding RXRX’s pipeline strategy, our expert noted that the company originally wanted to only \\nconduct biopharma partnerships to build out its pipeline. However, due to the loss of control in licensing \\nand back-end economics, as well as extended deal timelines, RXRX shifted toward an asset development \\nstrategy while building out novel, internal pipeline programs (all four of its clinical programs are from \\nasset development deals). RXRX has now shifted its focus back toward platform deals in its push to \\nbecome a drug discovery platform company instead of a clinical biotechnology company.  \\n \\nFor the exclusive use of Jonathan Livescault (jlivescault@pwpartners.com) at Perella Weinberg Partners\\nRecursion Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (RXRX US) \\nHealthcare Technology \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n38 \\nR&D productivity is critical  \\nThe deficiencies of traditional drug discovery methods include high costs, long timelines, and low \\nPoS in bringing lead candidates through the development process. Recent acceptance within the \\nindustry of tech-enabled drug discovery solutions that maximize R&D has widened the opportunity \\nfor our new companies under coverage to service the growing demand. We view R&D productivity \\nultimately as the relationship between the R&D spend needed to develop a new therapeutic and the \\nvalue produced from this new drug. Value in this context can be defined as the commercial and \\nmedical benefits of the new therapeutic developed.  \\nTo illustrate R&D productivity, we separate it into two parts: 1) R&D efficiency (inputs that lead to \\noutputs) and 2) R&D effectiveness (outputs that lead to outcomes). Inputs include investment in \\nR&D, outputs include new drugs reaching the market, and outcomes represent favorable treatments \\nfor patients from these new drugs. Recognizing the interdependencies of inputs, outputs, and \\noutcomes helps maximize overall R&D productivity through enabling more efficient, cheaper, and \\nsuccessful drug deliveries to market.  \\nExhibit 30: R&D productivity breakdown \\n \\nSource: Nature Reviews, Berenberg Capital Markets \\nR&D spend and ROI  \\nAccording to Deloitte, ROI from drug development for top biopharma companies has fallen to 1.9% \\nfrom 10.1% between 2010 and 2019. Inversely accompanying this is the growth of R&D costs during \\nthe same time frame, increasing to $2.16bn from $1.18bn per drug. We note one-third of these costs \\nare allocated to the drug discovery phase alone. The probability of novel candidates progressing \\nbeyond the pre-clinical phase and into Phase 1 trials has remained just under 10% over the past ten \\nyears. Our new specialty tech coverage leverages their platforms to maximize a drug candidate’s \\nprobability of success. For example, RXRX’s AI-enabled platform, which can identify patterns from \\nimage-based datasets, will generate actionable insights that enable programs to initiate and \\nprogress through the development cycle quicker, at a lower cost, and with decreased failure rates.  \\nTotal global pharma R&D spend within the industry is expected to grow at a CAGR of 3.2% overall \\nfrom 2019 to 2026, to reach $232.5bn (versus a 4.6% CAGR from 2012-2019; R&D spend in 2019 was \\n$186bn), according to EvaluatePharma’s 2020 World Preview report. This estimated reduction could \\nbe attributable to the expectation that R&D productivity and efficiency will grow over the next few \\nyears, driven by the industry’s adoption of digital innovation, such as AI, which should alleviate \\ncosts and drug candidate failure rates.  \\nFor the exclusive use of Jonathan Livescault (jlivescault@pwpartners.com) at Perella Weinberg Partners\\nRecursion Pharmaceuticals, Inc.

Driving this \\nhypothesis is the expected decline of R&D as a percentage of prescription drug sales (Rx sales). For \\nexample, AstraZeneca and Eli Lilly estimate they will cut R&D spend as a percentage of Rx sales by \\n4.6% and 5.2%, respectively, between 2019 and 2026. \\nExtended trial times weighing down R&D productivity \\nA crucial headwind that continues to dampen R&D productivity is the sustained growth of clinical \\ntrial timelines across all therapeutic areas. In oncology, clinical trial timelines are even longer than \\nother prominent indications. Prolonged clinical development schedules drive numerous issues, \\nincluding delays in bringing medicines to patients and increased costs attributed to any \\ndevelopment failures in potential drug candidates. Shortening clinical development times will \\nsignificantly improve R&D productivity and ROI for all industry players.  \\nExhibit 32: Average clinical cycle times, 2014-2019 \\n Exhibit 33: Clinical trial cycle time by indication, 2016-2019 \\n \\n \\n \\nSource: Deloitte \\n Source: Deloitte \\nFor the exclusive use of Jonathan Livescault (jlivescault@pwpartners.com) at Perella Weinberg Partners\\nRecursion Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (RXRX US) \\nHealthcare Technology \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n40 \\nCompanies in the tech-enabled drug discovery space are capable of shortening timelines in both \\nclinical development and initial molecule discovery. For example, predictive modeling and \\noptimization of the properties of lead drug candidates during the discovery phase maximizes the \\nprobability that each candidate will progress through development without efficacy, toxicity, \\nselectivity, and binding affinity issues. This slashes costs and increases the efficiency of the drug \\ndevelopment process, consistent with the overall benefits of utilizing smart technology, such as AI, \\nin this space. \\nHistorically, access to large amounts of capital and scale has also been a prerequisite to managing \\na novel drug through clinical trials. The combination of increased capital investment in the \\nbiotechnology sector (VC funding was $1.08bn in 2018 versus $237m in 2016) and greater focus on \\nhard-to-reach targets has positioned and empowered specialized companies to individually \\nmanage their own clinical trials for new drug candidates. Data from Deloitte indicates that 72% of \\n2018 late-stage pipeline programs (versus 61% a decade ago) focused on orphan drugs and oncology \\nare attributed to these newer, smaller-scale biopharma companies.

We note that AI can be applied to \\nvarious arms within the pharmaceutical industry, in addition to drug discovery and development. \\nExhibit 34: Applications of AI within pharmaceutical industry \\n \\nSource: Drug Discovery Today \\nThere is a breadth of suitable applications for AI and other smart technologies in various subfields within \\nthe pharmaceutical industry. However, we focus on the application of smart tech within drug discovery \\nand development. Within drug discovery, there are specific subfields to which AI can successfully be \\napplied – these include drug design, drug screening, and chemical synthesis, among others.  \\nExhibit 35: Roles of AI in drug discovery \\n \\nSource: Drug Discovery Today, Berenberg Capital Markets \\nFor the exclusive use of Jonathan Livescault (jlivescault@pwpartners.com) at Perella Weinberg Partners\\nRecursion Pharmaceuticals, Inc.

Providers of \\nthese solutions have largely been smaller, specialized companies with proprietary digital \\ntechnological solutions and scientific expertise. Seeking external innovation from companies like \\nRXRX and ABCL has been a critical component of the rapidly evolving R&D model in the \\nbiopharmaceutical industry.  \\nLarge biopharma companies are gaining access to AI drug discovery solutions through various \\navenues, including paying royalty agreements on co-developed commercialized drugs, commercial \\nand developmental milestone payments, technology access fees, option exercise fees, and acquiring \\nthe IP to assets in development. \\nIncreasing attention to AI in drug design and discovery \\nThe COVID-19 pandemic was a key tailwind in driving more attention toward technologies that can \\nenable drugs to progress from discovery to market more rapidly and efficiently. Similar to the recent \\ninflux of IPOs of specialized, technology-enabled drug discovery companies, widespread interest \\nand awareness in AI-enabled drug discovery can be also observed through spikes in AI conference \\nattendance, AI patents published, and AI peer-reviewed publications and journal articles.

The pharmaceutical industry has led all healthcare subsectors in drawing AI-\\nspecific funding. As more pharmaceutical companies and organizations understand and embrace \\nthe benefits of AI implementation within their specific businesses, investment demand and supply \\nwill continue to grow, in our view. We believe greater investment in AI-enabled solutions within \\nthe pharmaceutical industry, specifically within drug discovery and development, will continue to \\nenable efficient delivery of more novel therapeutics to market.  \\nFactors preventing greater adoption of smart tech today  \\nWhile there are many areas in which the use of AI would prove beneficial, its rollout is still in its \\nearly years. AI-based solutions within the pharmaceutical industry are projected by the NIPER-A to \\ngenerate $2.19bn revenues by 2022, representing a 21.9% CAGR from 2018. The value of AI supported \\nby Big Data in pharmaceutical operations is clear. Yet, a number of technical and ethical \\nconsiderations are hindering the widespread implementation of AI.  \\nData access headwinds \\nDue to the vast number of data libraries required to train smart machines such as advanced neural \\nnetworks, gaining access to them has become critical. Whether obtaining them from different \\ndatabases or from partnerships with specialized companies who have proprietary libraries, \\ncompanies must determine which path maximizes costs and resources spent to access high-quality \\nand reliable data. More data means more accurate and effective smart tech. Therefore, acquiring \\nthis new technology alone without requisite data access will place a ceiling on its realized benefits.  \\n5\\n5\\n5\\n4\\n4\\n4\\n3\\n3\\n2\\n2\\n1\\n1\\n1\\n1\\n1\\n1\\n1\\n1\\n1\\nAI-Driven Biopharma Deals Disclosed (2019)\\n# of Deals\\nFor the exclusive use of Jonathan Livescault (jlivescault@pwpartners.com) at Perella Weinberg Partners\\nRecursion Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (RXRX US) \\nHealthcare Technology \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n45 \\nLack of skilled personnel \\nSimilar to the headwinds facing data access, implementing smart tech without the team expertise \\nnecessary to work with and understand the technology will limit its advantages. RXRX, for example, \\nhas a combination of differentiated technology and a breadth of specialized personnel in areas such \\nas data science, engineering, biology, chemistry, and physics. Having personnel that can effectively \\noperate AI-based platforms is critical to enabling successful drug discovery.  \\nAn analogy that reflects this dynamic is a Formula 1 race. If a racing team is just given a Ferrari, \\nwhich is an elite and impressively engineered vehicle, this is only half the battle and does not \\nguarantee it a top finish. The team also needs to acquire a top driver and crew that can maximize \\nthe potential of the Ferrari in the race. In this case, the Ferrari is the smart tech-based discovery \\nplatform and the driver and crew are the specialized team of engineers and scientists. Successful \\ndrug discovery companies have cohesive teams that have worked together for years, progressively \\nimproving their respective platforms over time. These well-oiled teams that can leverage AI-based \\ntechnology act as significant competitive moat amidst growing numbers of specialized drug \\ndiscovery companies entering the space.  \\nLimited resources for smaller players \\nAlthough investment has been flooding into the drug discovery and development space, there are \\nstill many drug-discovery companies that lack the resources to develop and acquire both \\ncompetitive technologies and personnel. This hurdle creates a high barrier to entry for newer \\nplayers. Market leaders in AI-enabled drug discovery have the aforementioned technology and \\ntalent, as well as years of deep relationships with pharmaceutical and biotechnology partners. These \\nadvantages for established players make it difficult for new entrants to garner significant market \\nshare in the drug discovery space, even if these companies have unique platforms.  \\nPerception of replacing humans and job loss \\nThe most common misconception in integrating AI within any industry is that humans will largely \\nbe replaced, fueling widespread job loss. In most industries, particularly in drug discovery, AI \\nintegration is largely ineffective without the necessary personnel to help design and interpret many \\nof its functions. Conversely, narrow AI is a branch of AI that is intended to perform limited tasks (as \\nwith chatbots or virtual assistants) after being trained by a dataset (no extrapolation outside of the \\ntrained dataset). We believe this subset of AI is what largely threatens human job loss for these \\nrepetitive functions.  \\nWithin the drug development process, certain monotonous tasks in clinical trials, sales, and supply \\nchains in manufacturing, for example, will progressively become automated via narrow AI. \\nHowever, human involvement will be necessary in the implementation and operation of more \\ncomplex AI tasks in drug discovery and development, where human intelligence and insight is \\nrequired for interpreting and acting on the outputs of AI’s analysis.  \\nBlack box phenomenon and lack of regulation \\nNaturally, there will also be many who question conclusions that are reached by AI platforms. This \\nis known as the black box phenomenon. This phenomenon is apparent when viewers can see a \\nsystem’s or model’s inputs and outputs (in AI-integrated drug development, inputs are datasets and \\noutputs are the AI’s analyses and predictions) while lacking visibility into the internal infrastructure \\nthat ultimately produces each output.  \\nDue to the need of having all involved stakeholders on board with AI integration in drug discovery \\nand development, strict regulation must be in place to build this trust of all parties involved. We \\nbelieve proper regulation will help alleviate concerns regarding bias, ethical use, and the black box \\nphenomenon, for example. As regulatory frameworks become implemented, the integration of AI \\nin drug discovery and development will likely grow at a more rapid rate, while gaining more \\nacceptance across the industry. As more companies successfully implement disrupting smart \\ntechnologies, more will meet these growing requirements to achieve a higher level of productivity \\nand efficiency in the drug discovery and development processes. \\n \\nFor the exclusive use of Jonathan Livescault (jlivescault@pwpartners.com) at Perella Weinberg Partners\\nRecursion Pharmaceuticals, Inc.

Through \\nthe last decade, an increasing proportion of New Active Substances (NAS, approved by the EMA) \\nand New Molecular Entities (NME, approved by the FDA) have come from smaller companies in the \\nspace as opposed to the large, major biopharma players.  \\nExhibit 42: NME/NAS approvals, 2011-2019 \\n \\nSource: Deloitte \\nThe above data from a Deloitte case study indicates that new drug candidate approvals have been \\nincreasingly produced by smaller, specialized companies in the industry. These approved novel \\ndrugs carry higher pricing and market share and point to specialty tech companies taking market \\nshare in approved drug developments from large biopharma companies. These trends, including \\nthe increased capability of smaller companies to manage self-sustainable drug pipelines, are driving \\ntraditionally dominant biopharma players toward partnerships and collaborations with these \\nspecialized players. This new strategy is an effort to stay afloat and flexible in an environment \\nwhere an improved, modernized R&D model and innovative technological access is essential. \\nAs AI integration persists, it is likely that most drug discovery projects will be outsourced externally \\nto AI specialized companies. This will enable quicker discoveries of new drug candidates at lower \\ncosts, with greater probabilities of clinical success. According to DKA (Deep Knowledge Analytics), \\nthe top 15 biopharma companies, as of 2019, saw significant improvements to their bottom lines \\nafter adopting AI solutions in their drug development processes.

This modality has \\nlargely been leveraged in cancer vaccines and immunotherapies. A common example of a cell \\ntherapy is CAR (chimeric antigen receptor) T-cell therapy, in which the patient’s immune cells are \\naltered to better recognize and neutralize malignant cells in the body. Cell therapy provides \\nnumerous advantages, particularly in oncological treatment, including a far shorter administration \\ntime (just one infusion) versus multiple rounds of radiation therapy, for example. The first FDA-\\napproved cell-based therapy was in 2017 (CAR T-cell therapy) and it opened the door to the \\ncommercial market of this critical drug modality. While there is the potential for severe side effects \\nin cell therapy, such as neurotoxicity, these can be controlled with appropriate treatments.  \\nIn 2019, cell-based therapies had a TAM of ~$15bn and we anticipate this will increase to ~$17bn by \\n2025, representing a +60% CAGR. Many companies within the drug discovery and development \\nspace are recognizing the growing market opportunity of cell therapy, and are accordingly \\nbeginning to leverage their resources to penetrate and commercially capitalize on it. \\nCytokines \\nCytokines are complex proteins made by white blood cells that are responsible for the mediation of \\ncell-to-cell communication. To date, cytokine-based therapeutics have been leveraged both as a single \\nagent and in combination with other immunomodulator-based drugs. Immunomodulators (also \\ncalled biological response modifiers) are substances that activate or inhibit certain aspects of the \\nimmune system, such as checkpoints, in an effort to fight various diseases and infections in the body.  \\nAlthough cytokines have largely been integrated into drugs that treat cancer, they have been utilized \\nin therapies that treat other indications, such as IBD (inflammatory bowel disease) and various \\nautoimmune diseases. Many cytokine-based therapeutics are often a combination of already known \\nmolecules, but with newly engineered action processes. These new forms of therapeutics enable \\npharmaceutical and biotechnology companies to focus on new targets that can either address new \\ndiseases or help to repurpose current treatments for certain indications.  \\nRegarding oncology, cytokines are capable of activating immune cells to attack tumor cells. They \\nare also able to limit the spread of tumor cells through stimulated destruction of these cells (pro-\\napoptotic activity) or by limiting their ability to spread (anti-proliferative activity). Disadvantages of \\ncytokines when used as a monotherapy are largely attributed to their shorter half-life, as well as \\ntheir potentially shorter windows of anti-tumor efficacy. As a PoC, IL-2 and IFN-a are two cytokine-\\nFor the exclusive use of Jonathan Livescault (jlivescault@pwpartners.com) at Perella Weinberg Partners\\nRecursion Pharmaceuticals, Inc.

The latter \\nwas approved to treat melanoma, hairy cell leukemia, and follicular non-Hodgkin lymphoma, \\namong others, while the former was approved for the treatment of metastatic melanoma and late-\\nstage renal cell carcinoma (RCC).  \\nHowever, we note that newly developed immune checkpoint inhibitors (which have a better safety \\nprofile) and targeted therapeutics took priority in the treatment of these diseases. This is largely \\ndue to the toxicity and low response rate concerns with higher dose administrations of each of the \\naforementioned cytokine-based drugs. Owing to the few deficiencies of cytokine-based \\ntherapeutics when used as a monotherapy, efforts have been made in the clinic to test these \\ntherapeutics in combination with other biologics, such as mAbs and T-cell therapies. Combining \\ncytokines with certain mAbs via protein fusion, for example, helps maximize the half-life, \\ncirculation, and concentration of the cytokines when administered. These synergistic combination \\ntherapies enable better pharmacokinetic (PK) profiles and maximize anti-tumor efficacy, while \\ntempering toxicity concerns in patients.  \\nCytokine-based therapeutics are an evolving modality that require extensive knowledge and \\nexpertise in cytokine biology, as well as access to advanced biotechnology instrumentation to \\nenable successful discovery and development of these therapeutics. For oncological applications, \\nsuccess is defined as producing a therapeutic that captures muted toxicity while ensuring the \\noptimized efficacy against cancerous cells that cytokines enable. The ceiling for cytokine-based \\ntherapeutics is rising as cytokines can be dynamically leveraged in combination with various gene \\ntherapies, mAb therapies, and cell therapies for indications such as oncology, immunotherapy, and \\nanti-inflammatory diseases. \\nVaccines \\nVaccines are designed to activate a patient’s immune system such that it will memorize the targeted, \\ninvading pathogen if it enters the body in the future. These therapeutics are integrated with \\nantigenic components for the pathogen of interest, which is what triggers the immune system when \\ninjected. Vaccine development has been critical for years, with the COVID-19 pandemic fueling a \\nnew wave of vaccines worldwide. An impediment to vaccines achieving greater market growth is \\nthe large capital investment required for development.  \\nWhile the COVID-19 pandemic hindered vaccine growth in other indications, we expect these R&D \\nactivities in clinical vaccine development to escalate again moving forward. The cancer vaccine \\nmarket, for example, is expected to reach ~$11.7bn by 2026, according to Research and Markets’ Cancer \\nVaccines Global Market Outlook, representing a +7.6% CAGR from 2021. Globally, the vaccine market \\nvolume in 2019 is estimated to total 5.5bn doses, indicating a market value of $33bn (represents ~2% \\nof total pharmaceutical market), according to MI4A (Market Information for Access to Vaccines, \\nlaunched by the WHO). IMARC Group, a leading market research company, also published an \\nextensive report on the 2019 global vaccine market value, estimating it reached a slightly greater value \\nat $37bn. According to its projections, IMARC expects this value to increase at a 7.5% CAGR to $57bn in \\n2025.

As these factors \\ncontinue to develop, we see biologics continuing to gain market share, cutting into the historical \\ndominance in pipeline market share of small molecule based-drugs.  \\nProperties \\nCompared to small molecules, biologics are more target-specific and as a result have fewer \\ndetrimental side-effects on non-targets in the body. However, biologics may present external \\neffects that are largely related to excessive pharmacological action, which can stem from prolonged \\nuse or over-dosing. Structural characterization is also more complicated in biologics than in small \\nmolecules. Due to their complex structure, biologics research services from specialized companies, \\nsuch as contract research organizations (CROs) have been sought after by large pharmaceutical \\ncompanies and biotechnology companies. These specialized companies have a combination of \\nproprietary analytical technologies and cohesive teams of scientists and engineers that are capable \\nof utilizing these technologies and interpreting the data and analyses produced. The \\naforementioned capabilities are especially valuable for drug discovery and development partners to \\naccess when carrying out preclinical studies that require effective ADME (absorption, distribution, \\nmetabolism, and excretion) research. \\nBiologics have more challenging ADME and drug-like properties, greater instability, lower \\nmembrane permeability, limited distribution, and higher molecular weight (MW) than small \\nmolecules. The limited distribution in the body of biologics can be corrected in the future through \\ndifferent drug delivery technologies. As it stands today, methods such as subcutaneous injections \\nor infusions are being used to administer biologics, while oral delivery of biologics in patients is \\ncurrently unfeasible (oral delivery of various small molecule-based drugs are successful). Preclinical \\ninvestigations for biologics (ADME testing, etc.) vary from program to program and there are no \\nblanket regulations in place, as there are for small molecules. \\nBiosimilars versus generics \\nBiosimilars are drugs that are largely similar to already commercialized biologics. A notable \\ndistinction between generics and biosimilars is that the composition of a generic drug can be \\nidentical to its branded small molecule-based counterpart that is in the market (e.g., aspirin is a \\nsmall-molecule based drug with numerous, identical generic counterparts). In other words, \\ngenerics are “copies” of existing small molecule-based drugs, while biosimilars are “modeled” after \\nexisting biologics (hence why they are not called “bioidenticals”).

valuation is strongly driven by anticipated revenues for MaaT033 and the IO platform once those products hit \\nthe market as of 2027\\n>\\nOur valuation is mainly derived from MaaT033 and the

Patients can\\nthen be re-infused with own HSCs (autologous HSCT) or donor material (allogeneic HSCT) based on underlying pathology.

Those that do include oncology in their line \\nof sight use single-strains or consortia. As such, MaaT has a unique positioning \\nwith its full ecosystem approach in oncology\\n> The importance of the microbiome in HSCT outcomes has already been well \\nestablished in the literature through various preclinical and exploratory \\nclinical trials. This provides a strong scientific rationale for the development of \\nMaaT013 & MaaT033\\n> MaaT013 has demonstrated an excellent safety profile in the treatment of >70 \\npatients (Business section prospectus, p5)\\n> The MaaT013 early-access program allows for continuous gathering of data \\noutside of clinical trials, strengthening the drug’s overall data package and \\nacceptance in clinical practice\\n> The HERACLES phase II trial demonstrated strong results in steroid-\\nrefractory patients. The trial included only severely diseased, hard-to-treat \\n(grade III – IV) patients. Furthermore, the EAP has shown this effect to extend \\nto the ruxolitinib-resistant setting (3rd line). This favors MaaT013’s chances in \\n3rd line aGvHD treatment assessed in the ARES phase III trial, including grade II \\n– IV aGvHD patients\\n> MaaT is pioneering in attempts to develop a co-fermentation manufacturing \\nprocess to produce full ecosystem microbiome therapeutics at scale without \\ncontinuous dependency on donor material\\n> The biological material used as therapeutic is highly complex and difficult to \\ncharacterize in detail. As a result, the exact elucidation of the molecular mode of \\naction for microbiome therapeutics remains hard to pinpoint\\n> MaaT013 and MaaT033 are different formulations of the same biological \\nsubstance and can to some degree be considered as a single product with \\noverlapping risks\\n> While the local enema formulation has established proof-of-concept, this is not \\nthe case for oral formulation MaaT033. Oral administration and digestion may \\nimpact overall treatment outcomes and consistency in engraftment between \\nMaaT013 and MaaT033 needs to be demonstrated\\n> MaaT013’s enema formulation is suboptimal from a patient convenience \\nstandpoint. The product is therefore expected to meet a temporary need \\n(preferable over FMT) where higher potency is required (acute setting), until \\nmore convenient solutions become more widely available\\n> The manufacturing process of native pooled donor products MaaT013 and \\nMaaT033 is difficult to scale and only suitable for niche markets. MaaT requires \\nmajor screening and vetting campaigns (>3,000 potential volunteers to maintain \\n8-10 donors) with continuous rigorous monitoring. With regards to the co-\\nfermentation procedure, no clear cases of full ecosystem co-fermentation are \\navailable at commercial scale today\\n> Requirement of 1-years OS data for regulatory filing makes for long phase III \\nclinical trials in the HSCT prophylactic setting\\nProduced by KBC Securities NV (Belgium) • 38\\nAPPENDIX\\nOur SWOT analysis highlights MaaT’s pioneering potential in microbiome \\ntherapeutics, although this novel modality still faces some class-specific challenges\\nStrengths, weaknesses, opportunities & threats (2/2)\\nOpportunities\\nThreats\\n> Improvement of HSCT outcomes is considered an area of high unmet clinical \\nneed with little innovation. Regulators are permissive for novel drugs in the \\nsetting and payers are willing to reimburse well for products demonstrating clear \\nbenefit on GvHD, infection, survival, relapse etc.\\n> HSCT procedures are concentrated around a small number of specialized \\ncenters, which allows for fluent commercialization with limited resources. As a \\nresult, market penetration can reach high levels\\n> As the microbiome therapeutics space develops and matures as a novel \\ntreatment modality, it is likely to draw the attention of larger players looking \\nfor assets, technology & manufacturing expertise\\n> With immune checkpoint inhibitors reaching the limits of their clinical prowess \\nand being gigantic commercial successes, big pharma companies are eager to \\ncontinue to differentiate their PD-1 strategies from others and push into higher \\nlevels of clinical efficacy through combinations or explore novel indications. \\nAs such, microbiome therapies could provide for an easy and safe add-on \\ntherapy\\n> While MaaT focusses on the US and Europe, other regions may provide \\nopportunities for partnerships. Partners can also push the R&D agenda of the \\ncompany and trigger further co-development initiatives\\n> The regulatory and IP landscape surrounding microbiome therapeutics needs \\nto be developed in tandem with regulatory agencies and industry. As a pioneer in \\nthe full ecosystem space, MaaT can take an active role in the steering and \\npotential outcomes of those regulatory procedures\\n> Introduction of novel therapeutic options in haematological malignancies \\nsuch as AML could render the use of HSCT obsolete. This phenomenon was also \\nobserved in CML with the introduction of tyrosine kinase inhibitors\\n> Increasing response rates to PD-(L)1 drugs is actively explored by many and a \\nhighly competitive area. Incremental improvements by drugs such as MaaT03X \\nare not likely to command high pricing power\\n> Regulatory frameworks governing microbiome therapeutics are currently \\nmissing and provide for an unclear development and approval path.

VOR33 can\\naddress the vast majority of AML patients, as the CD33 antigen is expressed in\\nup to 90% of patients. Another important point of differentiation for VOR33 is\\nits streamlined manufacturing process, which allows for a significantly quicker\\nturnaround compared to current autologous eHSCs and other cell therapies.

CRISPR/Cas9 edited Hematopoietic stem cells \\n \\n• \\nVOR’s platform combines a novel patient engineering approach with targeted \\ntherapies to improve the curative potential of hematopoietic stem cell \\ntransplants. \\n• \\nVOR utilizes CRISPR/Cas9 technology to engineer HSCs. VOR can engineer both \\nautologous and allogeneic cells, regardless of source (e.g. peripheral blood, bone \\nmarrow, cord blood), and regardless of human leukocyte antigen (HLA) donor \\nmatch. \\n• \\nVOR’s eHSC manufacturing process is streamlined, with no cell expansion needs \\nnor new genetic materials delivered via viral vectors. VOR’s ability to rapidly \\nproduce eHSCs gives it an advantage over other genetically modified cell therapy \\napproaches, especially when timely treatments are required for rapidly \\nprogressing diseases. \\n \\n Lead eHSC candidate: VOR33 \\n \\n• \\nVOR33 is a CD33 knock out eHSC candidate for the treatment of CD33 expressing \\nhematologic malignancies, including acute myeloid leukemia, myeloproliferative \\nneoplasms (MPN), and myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS). By removing CD33, the \\ndonor HSCs (VOR33) and their progeny become treatment “invisible” to anti-\\nCD33 therapies, thereby limiting on-target toxicities and increasing the \\ntherapeutic index. \\n• \\nAssuming an annualized revenue of $450k per patient, (20% discount in EU & \\nJPN), we estimate ww sales of ~$1.2 billion by 2030. We assume a weighted peak \\nmarket penetration of ~30% in the global addressable population of ~$12,000 \\npatients, which represents the number of AML patients who receive allogeneic \\nHSCTs each year in the U.S., EU5, and Japan. \\n \\nCompanion therapeutic candidate: VCAR33 \\n \\n• \\nVCAR33 is an autologous CAR-T candidate that targets CD33. It is initially being \\ndeveloped as a bridge-to-transplant monotherapy for r/r AML patients. VOR is \\nalso developing an allogeneic version of VCAR33 which uses healthy donor-\\nderived cells that should improve persistence and in vivo expansion. \\n• \\nVOR is developing a VOR33 + VCAR33ALLO treatment system for the treatment of \\nAML patients in the post-transplant setting. The treatment system will source \\ncells from the same healthy donor for both VOR33 and VCARALLO, potentially \\nreducing the risk of GvHD. \\n• \\nAssuming an annualized revenue of $300k per patient, (20% discount in EU & \\nJPN), we estimate ww sales in the bridge-to-transplant setting of ~$410MM by \\n2031. In this setting, we assume a peak market penetration of ~20% in the global \\naddressable population of ~8,500, which represent the number of transplant \\neligible AML patients that relapse after receiving 1L therapy each year. We see a \\nbigger opportunity for VCAR33 as part of a treatment system with VOR33. In this \\nsetting, we assume that all ~12,000 AML patients that receive allogeneic HSCT \\nare eligible to receive VCAR33, and model a peak market penetration of ~35%, \\nwhich translates to ww sales of $906MM in 2031. \\n \\n \\nPage 4\\nwww.wedbush.com\\nValuation \\n \\n• \\nInitiating coverage with an OUTPERFORM rating and an $18 price target. Our \\nPT is derived from a sum-of-parts valuation for each of the company’s clinical or \\nnear-clinical programs: an 8x multiple of 2030E ww sales of VOR33 (discounted \\nback by 40%), and an 8x multiple of 2031E ww sales of VCAR33 (discounted back \\nby 40%). \\n \\nFigure 1: VOR Pipeline Chart \\n \\nSource: Company data\\nPage 5\\nwww.wedbush.com\\n \\nVOR’s Platform: Engineered Hematopoietic Stem Cells (eHSC) \\n \\nVOR’s next generation eHSC platform aims to combine a novel patient engineering approach with \\ntargeted therapies to address challenging hematologic malignancies, with an initial focus on acute \\nmyeloid leukemia (AML). Despite the progress made with newer targeted therapies for AML, \\nhematopoietic stem cell transplants (HSCT) remain the only treatment option capable of a long-\\nterm complete remission, and targeted therapies are preferred to HSCT only in transplant-\\nineligible patients and in the post-transplant, relapsed setting. However, for patients undergoing \\nHSCT, approximately 40% relapse, with a dismal prognosis. While targeted therapies are used in \\nthese patients, their utility has been limited by the expression of tumor targets on healthy cells, \\nresulting in on-target toxicity and thereby limiting the therapeutic window. VOR aims to change \\nthe treatment paradigm by introducing “stealth” transplants (Figure 2) that are able to survive \\nsubsequent therapies that can clear remaining malignant cells. HSCs are collected from healthy \\ndonors and genetically modified to remove antigens expressed by cancer cells and that are \\nunnecessary for stem cell survival. These eHSCs are transplanted into patients, rendering the \\npatients’ HSCs and progeny cells “invisible” to targeted therapies (Figure 3). VOR believes this will \\nenable targeted therapies to selectively destroy cancer cells while sparing normal myeloid lineage \\ndevelopment and function, thereby potentially avoiding myelosuppression and increasing the \\ntherapeutic index of the targeted therapy. VOR33 is the company’s lead eHSC candidate, with an \\ninitial focus on CD33+ AML. To complement its eHSC platform, VOR is developing specific \\ncompanion therapeutics that are optimized for use with its eHSCs. \\n \\nFigure 2: Changing the Traditional Tumor Target Paradigm \\n \\nSource: Company S-1 filing \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\nPage 6\\nwww.wedbush.com\\n \\nFigure 3: VOR Treatment Approach \\n \\nSource: Company S-1 filing \\n \\nVOR uses CRISPR/Cas9 to engineer VOR33. VOR’s platform has the ability to engineer autologous \\nand allogeneic cells, regardless of source (e.g. peripheral blood, bone marrow, cord blood), and \\nregardless of human leukocyte antigen (HLA) match status of the donor. VOR’s eHSC \\nmanufacturing process is highly streamlined, due to no need for cell expansion nor new genetic \\nmaterials delivered via viral vectors. VOR can produce VOR33 from the starting apheresis product \\nin approximately 3 days, enabling a vein-to-vein time of 7 to 10 days (Figure 4). This compares to \\nmanufacturing cycle times of 7 to 14 days for autologous eHSCs (Figure 5). The speed at which VOR \\nis able to supply AML patients with its eHSCs serves as another important advantage, as AML \\npatients can rapidly progress. \\n \\nFigure 4: VOR eHSC Manufacturing Process \\n \\nSource: Company data \\n \\nFigure 5: Key eHSC Manufacturing Specifications and Comparators \\n \\nSource: Company S-1 filing \\n \\n \\nPage 7\\nwww.wedbush.com\\n \\nVOR’s HSC engineering approach has high efficiency and is reproducible preclinically. The company \\nconducts extensive analyses on its eHSCs to determine if their gene modifications result in any \\nunintended alterations elsewhere in the genome or on the distribution of progeny cells, with \\nprioritization of guide RNA (gRNA) sequences that have high ability to direct a precise cutting of \\nthe targeted gene. In preclinical studies, VOR’s process resulted in the removal of CD33 from >86% \\nof cells in 6 independent healthy donors using 2 different gRNAs (Figure 6a). In other preclinical \\nstudies, VOR’s process resulted in 88% biallelic removal of CD33 from 84 single cell colonies, all \\nderived from one healthy donor (Figure 6b). \\n \\nThe company has entered a number of strategic partnerships to strengthen its eHSC platform. In \\n2020, VOR entered non-exclusive collaborations with two next-generation gene editing \\ncompanies, Arbor Biotechnologies (private) and Metagenomi (private), with the goal of leveraging \\ntheir technologies and preclinical research to develop eHSCs for hematological malignancies.  \\n \\nFigure 6: Removal of CD33 in HSCs \\n \\nSource: Company S-1 filing \\n \\nProgram Overviews \\n \\nVOR’s pipeline consists of lead eHSC program VOR33, and its companion therapeutic VCAR33 \\nwhich is being developed as both autologous and allogeneic CAR T therapies. These programs will \\ninitially target acute myeloid leukemia (AML). VOR is also developing a VOR33/VCAR33ALLO \\ncombined treatment approach which may also have potential to treat other hematological \\nmalignancies that overexpress CD33, including myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) and \\nmyeloproliferative neoplasms (MPN). \\n \\nVOR33 (Lead eHSC candidate) \\n \\nVOR’s lead program, VOR33, is a donor hematopoietic stem cell that is genetically modified to \\nremove CD33 surface antigens that are expressed on leukemic blasts in up to 90% of AML patients. \\nThe modification should make the cells “invisible” to targeted therapies that kill residual cancer \\ncells. By removing CD33, the donor HSCs (VOR33) and their progeny become treatment resistant \\nto anti-CD33 therapies and enable these treatments to selectively target malignant cells while \\nsparing healthy cells, limiting on-target toxicities. VOR believes that combining its eHSCs with \\ntargeted therapies, such as CAR-T or bispecific antibodies, has the potential to create a paradigm \\nshift in the treatment landscape for AML and other hematologic malignancies. \\n \\n \\n \\nPage 8\\nwww.wedbush.com\\n \\nBackground: Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML) \\n \\nAML is a heterogenous hematologic cancer that causes the body to produce too many immature \\nmyeloblastic cells, limiting healthy blood cell formation. The majority of AML cases occur in older \\nadults, where it is the most common type of acute leukemia. In 2021, there were an estimated \\n~20k newly-diagnosed AML patients in the US, and approximately 11.4K patients died from the \\ndisease (SEER estimates). AML patients have a poor prognosis, with a 5-year survival rate of just \\n29.5%. With treatment, complete remission rates have consistently been in the range of 60%-70% \\nin younger patients and ~50% in older patients, however relapse tends to occur relatively quickly \\nin most patients leading to the low long-term survival rates. \\n \\nAccording to the NCCN guidelines (NCCN, 2022), treatment for AML (with the exception of the \\nacute promyelocytic leukemia subtype) is usually divided into phases including induction \\nchemotherapy and post-remission or consolidation therapy (Figure 7). Most patients will begin \\ntreatment with chemotherapy, sometimes in combination with a targeted therapy for those \\npatients whose leukemia cells have a genetic mutation. Induction chemotherapy is usually short \\nand intensive with the goal reducing the number of blasts in the blood and bone marrow. \\nConsolidation therapy is given after the patient has recovered from induction and is used to kill \\nthe small number of leukemia cells that may be left after induction therapy. Post-remission therapy \\nusually includes additional chemotherapy or stem cell transplants. Initial treatment decisions are \\nbased on age, history of prior myelodysplasia or cytotoxic therapy, and performance status, with \\ndifferent treatment recommendations for patients older or younger than 60 years of age. \\nChemotherapy most often used for induction is a combination of cytarabine and an anthracycline, \\nsuch as daunorubicin or idarubicin. Standard consolidation therapies include high-dose cytarabine \\n(HiDAC) for core binding factor (CBF) AML patients who are minimal residual disease (MRD) \\nnegative, and matched sibling or alternative donor hematopoietic stem cell transplantation for \\npatients who have MRD or have intermediate risk to unfavorable cytogenetics. Consolidation \\ntherapy options for patients who are older are usually less intensive and include standard-dose \\ncytarabine and non-myeloablative stem cell transplant. Since its approval in 2018, Venetoclax \\n(BCL-2 inhibitor) based combination regimens have been adopted as the new standard of care for \\nthe initial treatment of older or unfit AML patients.   \\n \\nFigure 7: AML Treatment Flow Diagram \\n \\nSource: Company S-1 filing \\n \\nOver the past 2 decades, HSCT as a treatment for AML has been on the rise (Figure 8), as it has \\ndemonstrated a high rate of durable remission. VOR estimates there are 3,365 HSCTs for AML in \\nthe U.S. annually. However, despite undergoing HSCT, approximately 40% of post-stem cell \\ntransplant AML patients will relapse and face an extremely poor prognosis with a 2-year survival \\nPage 9\\nwww.wedbush.com\\n \\nrate of less than 20% (Tsirigotis et al., 2016). Patients who had MRD prior to HSCT have an even \\nhigher relapse rate of 67% (Figure 9). Post-transplant treatment options are limited to \\nchemotherapy/salvage therapies, donor lymphocyte infusions and/or second transplants and \\nprovide limited benefit. While targeted therapies, such as Mylotarg, have proven efficacious as a \\nsalvage therapy for AML, its utility has been limited by on-target toxicity such as hepatic veno-\\nocclusive disease (VOD) and ultimately the benefits are short-lived. According to the National \\nCancer Database, the post-transplant survival rate for AML patients was ~44% from 1998 to 2011, \\nshowing the significant unmet need for novel HSCT and other post-HSCT therapies.  \\n \\nFigure 8: Use of Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplant is Increasing \\n \\nSource: Company 2021 10-K filing \\n \\nFigure 9: AML Patients with Residual Cancer Cells are at Higher Risk of Rapid Relapse \\n \\nSource: Company S-1 filing \\n \\nMylotarg: VOR33’s First Companion Therapeutic \\n \\nAbout 85–90% of AML cases express the CD33 antigen (Figure 9). Accordingly, CD33 has gained \\nclinical importance as a target for AML therapies. Currently, Mylotarg (gemtuzumab ozogamicin) \\nis the only CD33 targeted therapy approved by the FDA (Figure 10) for the treatment of AML. The \\nPage 10\\nwww.wedbush.com\\n \\ndevelopment of other CD33 targeted therapies, including Seattle Genetics’ (SGEN, not covered) \\nSGN-CD33A, have been stymied by myelosuppression caused by on-target toxicity (Figure 11). \\n \\nFigure 9: Rate of Expression in Bulk AML Patient Samples and Leukemic Stem Cells \\n \\nSource: Company S-1 filing \\n \\nFigure 10: Third-party CD33-directed Products and Product Candidates \\n \\nSource: Company S-1 filing, Wedbush Research \\n \\nPage 11\\nwww.wedbush.com\\n \\nFigure 11: Myelosuppressive Effects of Third-party CD33-directed Products \\n \\nSource: Company 2021 10-K filing \\n \\nMylotarg is Pfizer’s (PFE, not covered) anti-CD33 antibody drug conjugate (ADC) which has \\nvalidated the anti-CD33 antibody approach, and is the first companion therapeutic that VOR is \\nevaluating in its initial clinical trial. Once Mylotarg binds to CD33 antigen and is internalized, the \\nwarhead, a calicheamicin derivative, is released inside the cell, where it causes DNA double strand \\nbreaks and cell death. Mylotarg was originally approved in 2000 for 2L CD33 positive AML patients \\nover 60 years of age who were ineligible for other cytotoxic chemotherapy. Mylotarg was \\nvoluntarily withdrawn from the US market in 2010 after a confirmatory trial failed to demonstrate \\nclinical benefit and also showed a higher rate of fatal toxicity compared to chemotherapy. As this \\nresulted in a critical unmet need for patients with AML, independent AML clinicians conducted \\nclinical trials evaluating Mylotarg at different doses and schedules. Based on the results of several \\ninvestigator-initiated trials including ALFA-0701, AML-19 and MyloFrance01.1, Mylotarg was \\napproved in 2017 for adults with newly diagnosed CD33+ AML, as well as for adult and pediatric \\nr/r CD33+ AML. \\n \\nALFA-701 was a Ph 3, multicenter, randomized study of 271 patients with newly diagnosed de-\\nnovo AML, using a lower fractionated dose of Mylotarg. The study met its primary endpoint of \\nevent-free survival, with patients treated with Mylotarg in addition to chemotherapy (n=135) \\nachieving event-free survival of 17.3 months compared with 9.5 months for patients treated with \\nchemotherapy alone (HR=0.56). AML-19 was a Ph 3 study comparing single agent Mylotarg to best \\nsupportive care for elderly patients who could not tolerate other AML treatments. Patients treated \\nwith Mylotarg had improved median overall survival (OS) of 4.9 months compared with 3.6 months \\nfor patients who received best supportive care (HR=0.69). MyloFrance-1 was a Ph 2, single-arm \\nstudy evaluating the efficacy of Mylotarg in adult AML patients in first relapse. 26% (15/57) of \\npatients achieved a complete remission and median relapse free survival was 11.6 months. \\n \\nDue to CD33 expression on a broad set of hematologic progenitor cells, Mylotarg attacks both AML \\nand healthy blood cells, leading to on-target toxicity including thrombocytopenia and neutropenia, \\nas seen in Figure 11 above. This has limited Mylotarg’s clinical utility.  \\n \\nPage 12\\nwww.wedbush.com\\n \\nPreclinical development and validation of CD33 deletion in HSCs \\n \\nVOR conducted a series of experiments to assess the resistance of its engineered HSCs and their \\nprogeny to Mylotarg. Using in vitro cytotoxicity assays, VOR studied the effects of various \\nconcentrations of Mylotarg on HSCs that were genetically engineered to remove CD33 (CD33Del), \\nas well as wild type cells (CD33WT). As the engineered cells were not enriched for CD33 deletion, \\nsome cell death was expected based on residual CD33 expression. CD33Del cells showed a ~70-\\nfold increase in IC50 compared to CD33WT cells, up until extreme Mylotarg concentrations, which \\ncaused similar levels of cell death between CD33WT and CD33Del (Figure 12). Additionally, \\nxenograft studies were conducted to evaluate the response of CD33Del blood cells in the presence \\nof Mylotarg. The results demonstrated enhanced in vivo survival of CD14+ cells in mice that were \\nengrafted with CD33Del eHSCs, compared to mock-electroporated wild type cells. \\n \\nIn xenotransplant mouse models, VOR observed that CD33 could be knocked out without any \\nadverse effects on cell differentiation or immune function of hematopoietic cells. CD33Del eHSCs \\nwere able to differentiate into nucleated bone marrow cells, B cells and myeloid cells with the \\nsame distribution as unmodified HSCs (Figure 13). VOR also assessed the ability of the \\ndifferentiated immune cells derived from eHSCs to fight pathogens via phagocytosis assays and \\ncytokine production assays. CD33WT and CD33Del cells had similar phagocytosis activity both \\nwhen in the presence of e. coli and of cytochalasin D (Figure 14a). Additionally, cytokine responses \\nof cells derived from eHSCs to pathogen triggering agents, such as lipopolysaccharide and \\nresiquimod, were identical to those generated by cells derived from unmodified HSCs (Figure 14b). \\n \\nAdditional in vivo testing in mice and non-human primates have been separately conducted by \\nColumbia University, the University of Pennsylvania, and the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research \\nCenter, where each of the research groups have independently confirmed the absence of \\ndeleterious effects from CD33Del cell transplants. Furthermore, healthy people have been found \\nto have absent CD33 expression, suggesting CD33 expression is not required for normal life. Using \\nexisting genetics data from the Broad Institute’s genome aggregation database (gnomAD), VOR \\nhas identified 65 individuals with naturally occurring mutations that have inactivated the CD33 \\ngene. These data, along with the lack of effect on cell functionality and differentiation observed in \\nvivo and in vitro when CD33 is knocked out, appear to point to normal functionality of CD33Del \\neHSCs in humans. \\n \\nFigure 12: VOR33: Resistance to CD33 Therapy \\n \\nSource: Company data \\n \\n \\n \\n \\nPage 13\\nwww.wedbush.com\\n \\nFigure 13: No Observed Impact on Cell Populations \\n \\n \\nSource: Company data \\n \\nFigure 14: No Observed Impact on Cell Functionality \\n \\n \\nSource: Company data \\n \\nPage 14\\nwww.wedbush.com\\n \\nVOR also evaluated the effectiveness of its genome engineering platform in creating CD33Del \\neHSCs by comparing the input cells with bone marrow (output) cells after 4 months of engraftment \\nin the above mentioned xenotransplant models. The studies demonstrated that the editing \\nfrequency of input cells were very similar to the editing frequency of bone marrow cells (Figure \\n15a), and that CD33-edited cells can persist long-term in vivo. An indel species distribution study \\nshowed that the molecular signatures generated by insertion-deletion mutations (indels) were \\ntrackable over the long-term (Figure 15b), suggesting there is no selective pressure towards or \\nagainst any specific indel species. \\n \\nFigure 15: Editing Frequency and Indel Species Distribution \\n \\nSource: Company S-1 filing \\n \\nClinical development plan \\n \\nVOR is enrolling patients in its VBP101 Ph1/2a study evaluating VOR33 + Mylotarg in CD33 positive \\nAML patients who are at high risk of relapse (Figure 16). Patients will be screened for those who \\nachieved morphologic remission. VOR33 will be administered to patients following myeloablative \\nconditioning. After engraftment, patients who relapse will be treated with therapeutic doses of \\nMylotarg, while other patients will be treated with maintenance doses of Mylotarg at 60 days post-\\ntransplant to eliminate MRD. VOR will assess the safety and tolerability of VOR33 by monitoring \\nthe incidence and severity of graft versus host disease (GvHD) and incidence of graft failure. Other \\nkey readouts will include engraftment data at 28 days post-transplant and safety data regarding \\nprotection from myelosuppressive effects and other hematopoietic toxicities associated with \\nMylotarg. VOR also intends to monitor patients for the presence of MRD, and collect data around \\nrelapse-free survival and overall survival. We see a strong preclinical rationale for VOR’s approach \\nand positive results from the clinical study could de-risk the program and validate VOR’s broader \\neHSC platform. In September 2021, VOR33 was granted a Fast-Track designation for the treatment \\nof AML, which allows for potential facilitated development and expedited review process. VOR \\nexpects to report initial clinical data, including neutrophil engraftment data, from VBP101 in 2H22. \\n \\nOver time, we expect relapse-free survival to exceed the historical norms for this population of 7 \\nmonths (Bejanyan et al., 2014), supporting the continued development in AML patients. We also \\nexpect to see ~95% engraftment for VOR33, with improved tolerability compared to current \\ntreatment regimens containing Mylotarg. Figure 17 outlines the company’s standards of success \\nfor its VBP101 study. \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\nPage 15\\nwww.wedbush.com\\n \\nFigure 16: Schematic Design of VBP101: VOR33+Mylotarg Ph ½a Clinical Trial \\n \\nSource: Company S-1 filing \\n \\nFigure 17: Success Metrics for VBP101 \\n \\nSource: Company S-1 filing \\n \\nAdditional Development Opportunities for VOR33 \\nIn addition to AML, VOR is exploring VOR33’s myelo-protective potential in other CD33 \\noverexpressing hematologic malignancies, including myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) and \\nmyeloproliferative neoplasm (MPN). Myelodysplastic syndromes are a type of rare blood cancers \\nwhere dysplastic bone marrow cells do not generate enough healthy blood cells (usually RBCs) and \\nabnormally high levels of myeloblasts accumulate in the bone marrow. According to the American \\nCancer Society, about 1 in 3 MDS patients see their condition evolve into AML. Myeloproliferative \\nneoplasms describe a group of blood disorders that are characterized by an abnormally high \\nproduction of mature blood cells in the bone marrow. MPNs include chronic myelogenous \\nleukemia, polycythemia vera, essential thrombocythemia, primary myelofibrosis, chronic \\neosinophilic leukemia and chronic neutrophilic leukemia. Certain neoplasms, such as primary \\nmyelofibrosis, polycythemia vera and essential thrombocythemia can also evolve into AML. \\nOutside of AML, myeloproliferative disorders are the most common indications for allogeneic \\nHSCTs (Passweg et al., 2019). VOR believes that VOR33 has the potential to open a therapeutic \\nwindow for CD33 targeted therapies to be used in these settings. Accordingly, VOR is exploring \\npotential combinations with companion therapeutics.  \\n \\n \\n \\nPage 16\\nwww.wedbush.com\\n \\nVOR33 with Other Companion Therapeutics \\nVOR chose to use Mylotarg as the initial companion therapeutic for VOR33 as Mylotarg is currently \\nthe only CD33 targeted therapy approved by the FDA for the treatment of AML. However, the \\ncompany is exploring options to combine VOR33 with a wide range of cancer therapies, thereby \\nexpanding its potential market opportunity. On June 10, 2021, VOR entered a collaboration with \\nAbound Bio (private) to develop single and multi-targeted CAR-T therapies for use in combination \\nwith VOR’s eHSC platform, in the treatment of AML and other blood cancers. Financial terms of \\nthe partnership agreement were not disclosed. On July 8, 2021, VOR entered a collaboration with \\nJNJ to combine its eHSC platform with one of Janssen’s bi-specific antibodies in development for \\nthe treatment of AML.  \\n \\nVCAR33 (CD33 Targeted CAR-T Cell Candidate) \\n \\nVOR is developing VCAR33AUTO as a single agent bridge-to-transplant therapy for \\nrelapsed/refractory AML. VCAR33, originally developed at the National Institutes of Health (NIH), \\nis an engineered T-cell that has been modified with a chimeric antigen receptor that targets the \\nCD33 protein using a huM195 CD33 binder. VCAR33ALLO is VOR’s second anti-CD33 CAR-T program \\nwhich uses HLA-matched healthy donor cells as its cell source. The company plans to submit an \\nIND to evaluate VCAR33ALLO for the treatment of r/r AML patients in the bridge-to-transplant \\nsetting in 1H23. VOR also plans to develop VCAR33ALLO in the post-transplant maintenance setting \\nas a companion therapeutic to VOR33 following data from its VBP101 study in 2H22 and initial \\nclinical data from VCAR33ALLO. The VOR33/VCAR33ALLO treatment system will use the same healthy \\ndonor cell source for both VOR33 and VCAR33ALLO. This provides the advantage of a more potent \\nand plentiful starting product, allowing for broader access, improved manufacturing efficiencies \\nand a generally more consistent product. Another important advantage of sourcing VOR33 and \\nVCAR33 from the same donor is the reduced risk of donor-derived host T-cells turning on CAR-T \\ncells, potentially prolonging persistence. \\n \\nPreclinical development \\n \\nThe NIH assessed the anti-tumor activity of various CAR-T constructs, including a CAR using a \\nhuM195 CD28 binder (VCAR33), in human AML xenograft models. Over the 10-week experiment, \\nVCAR33 demonstrated enhanced activity against AML cells compared to CAR constructs targeting \\nthe 4-1BB costimulatory domain (Figure 18). In other studies, VCAR33 demonstrated a better \\ntoxicity profile than CD28 targeting CAR constructs containing the hP67.6 binder, which is the same \\nbinder used in Mylotarg. Based on the results of the preclinical studies, the NIH has decided to \\nadvance VCAR33 into a first-in-human Ph 1/2 clinical trial.  \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\nPage 17\\nwww.wedbush.com\\n \\nFigure 18: Tumor Cell Clearance of CAR Constructs in Mouse Xenograft Models  \\n \\nSource: Company S-1 filing \\n \\nVCAR33 Clinical Development \\n \\nVCAR33AUTO is currently in a National Marrow Donor Program (NMDP) sponsored Ph 1/2 proof of \\nconcept trial, evaluating the preliminary efficacy and safety of VCAR33 in young adult and pediatric \\npatients with r/r AML. The dose escalation portion of the trial will enroll 12 patients and follow a \\n3 + 3 trial design to determine the maximum tolerated dose. The dose expansion portion of the \\ntrial is expected to enroll up to 16 patients and is designed to evaluate clinical response. Key \\nefficacy endpoints will include morphologic remission rates as assessed by reduction of the blast \\ncount in the bone marrow, elimination of minimal residual disease (MRD) as assessed by flow \\ncytometry or molecular methods, as well as the proportion of patients who are able to proceed to \\nHSCT following treatment with VCAR33. The trial will also evaluate standard transplant-related \\noutcomes including overall survival, relapse rates and event-free survival. Exploratory endpoints \\nwill include expansion and persistence of VCAR33 in the peripheral blood and bone marrow. As for \\nCAR-T related safety outcomes, trial investigators will monitor patients for evidence of cytokine \\nrelease syndrome, hepatotoxicity and neurotoxicity. Additionally, to assess the safety of VCAR33 \\nin combination with HSCT, patients will be monitored for graft versus host disease incidence, \\ntreatment-related mortality and time to engraftment, post-transplant. VOR expects to assume \\nsponsorship of this trial prior to completion or enter into an agreement with the NMDP for the \\nright to cross-reference study results in future IND applications. Initial data from this trial is \\nexpected in 2022.  \\n \\nVCAR33ALLO Clinical Development \\n \\nVOR plans to file an IND for its VCAR33ALLO program in 1H23. The study design of the Ph 1/2 clinical \\ntrial will follow the design of the NMDP sponsored trial of VCAR33AUTO, although the VCAR33ALLO \\nstudy will enroll older AML patients, also in the bridge-to-transplant setting. Key efficacy, safety \\nand exploratory endpoints of the VCAR33ALLO trial will mirror those for the VCAR33AUTO study.  \\n \\n \\n \\n \\nPage 18\\nwww.wedbush.com\\n \\nVOR33/VCAR33 Treatment System – Clinical Development \\n \\nVOR plans to file an IND for its VOR33/VCAR33ALLO treatment system and initiate a clinical trial \\nfollowing the initial results from the Ph 1/2a VBP101 study of VOR33 + Mylotarg, and initial clinical \\ndata from the Ph 1/2 study of VCAR33ALLO. The study will be designed to assess the safety and initial \\nefficacy of the VOR33/ VCAR33ALLO treatment system, where VCAR33ALLO will be evaluated in a \\npost-VOR33 transplant setting. The company believes that the enhanced persistence of \\nVCAR33ALLO should enable more effective and long-term killing of CD33+ tumor cells, potentially \\nleading to prolonged remissions or cures in a post-transplant setting, with reduced on-target \\nmyeloablative toxicities due to the protection offered by VOR33. \\n \\neHSC Platform Expansion \\n \\nVOR plans to extend its eHSC approach to targets beyond CD33. The company is evaluating its \\neHSC technology in other surface targets, including CD123, CLL-1, EMR2 and CD5, that are \\noverexpressed on hematologic malignancies for which targeted therapies have been developed, \\nbut have not been successful in the clinic due to their on-target, off-tumor toxicities. As part of its \\ntarget identification process, VOR combs through human genomic databases to look for naturally \\noccurring mutations that have inactivated the gene for the target, which would suggest that a gene \\nknockout would not result in any deleterious effects. VOR will prioritize targets for which a \\ntargeted therapy is available or is in clinical development, with discovery efforts focused on \\ncommonly transplanted hematologic malignancies. Eventually, VOR plans to develop or co-\\ndevelop its own companion therapeutic candidates for use in combination with its eHSCs. VOR has \\ndemonstrated high editing frequency in CD34+ cells for myeloid targets CD123, CLL-1 and EMR2, \\nas well as T cell target CD5 (Figure 19). VOR is researching various gene inactivation techniques in \\norder to maximize yield and further increase editing efficiency, while reducing off-target \\nalterations.  \\n \\nFigure 19: High Editing Frequency for Next Generation Targets \\n \\nSource: Company 2021 10-K filing \\n \\nIn Vitro Studies of CD123 \\n \\nVOR conducted various in vitro studies comparing the differentiation and functional activity of \\nengineered HSCs (CD123Del eHSCs) and their progeny to that of wild-type HSCs (CD123WT HSCs). \\nOver a 14-day period, CD123Del eHSC derived granulocyte and monocyte cells sustained lower \\nCD123 positivity levels compared to wild-type (WT). There was no difference observed in the rate \\nPage 19\\nwww.wedbush.com\\n \\nat which CD123Del eHSCs differentiated into various classes of blood cells, including CD15 positive, \\nCD11b positive and CD14 positive cells. Furthermore, phagocytic assays and cytokine production \\nassays demonstrated that CD123Del eHSCs retained functional activity that was identical to that \\nof WT cells, suggesting that CD123 knockout had no adverse effects on cellular function (Figure \\n20).  \\n \\nIn another experiment, VOR knocked out CD123 from MOLM-13 AML cell lines and exposed the \\nCD123Del MOLM-13 cell lines to an anti-CD123 CAR-T therapy. CD123Del AML cell lines \\ndemonstrated statistically significantly higher rates of survival compared to CD123WT cells when \\nexposed to an anti-CD123 agent (Figure 21). These early preclinical results point to the possibility \\nof better clinical outcomes in anti-CD123 therapy treated patients who receive CD123Del eHSCs. \\n \\nFigure 20: CD123Del and CD123WT HSCs- Differentiation and Functional Activity of Progeny Cells \\n \\nSource: Company S-1 filing \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\nPage 20\\nwww.wedbush.com\\n \\nFigure 21: CD123Del Cells in the Presence of an Anti-CD123 CAR-T Therapy \\n \\nSource: Company S-1 filing \\n \\nIn Vitro Studies in CLL-1 \\n \\nSimilar to the in vitro studies conducted in CD123, VOR compared the differentiation and \\nfunctional activity of modified HSCs (CLL-1Del eHSCs) and their progeny to that of wild-type HSCs \\n(CLL-1WT HSCs) over a 14-day period. CLL-1Del eHSC derived granulocyte and monocyte cells \\nshowed lower CLL-1 positivity levels compared to wild-type (WT). There was no difference \\nobserved in the rate at which CLL-1Del eHSCs differentiated into various classes of blood cells, \\nincluding CD15 positive, CD11b positive and CD14 positive cells. Additionally, phagocytic assays \\nand cytokine production assays demonstrated that CLL-1Del eHSCs retained functional activity that \\nwas identical to that of WT cells, suggesting that CLL-1 knockout had no adverse effects on cellular \\nfunction (Figure 22).  \\n \\nVOR also monitored the survival rates of CLL-1Del HL-60 AML cell lines that were exposed to an \\nanti-CLL-1 CAR-T therapy. CLL-1Del AML cell lines demonstrated statistically significantly higher \\nrates of survival compared to CLL-1WT cells when exposed to an anti-CLL-1 agent (Figure 23).  \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\nPage 21\\nwww.wedbush.com\\n \\nFigure 22: CLL-1Del and CLL-1WT HSCs – Differentiation and Functional Activity of Progeny Cells \\n \\n \\nSource: Company S-1 filing \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\nPage 22\\nwww.wedbush.com\\n \\nFigure 23: Survival Rate of CLL-1Del Cell Lines Exposed to an Anti-CLL-1 CAR-T Therapy \\n \\nSource: Company S-1 filing \\n \\nIn Vivo Studies in CD123 and CLL-1 \\n \\nVOR assessed the viability and functionality of CD123Del and CLL-1Del cells in vivo using xeno-\\ntransplant models. At 16 weeks, mice that received CD123Del and CLL-1Del HSCPs had statistically \\nsignificant reductions in CD123+ and CLL-1+ cells compared to control (electroporation only), \\ndemonstrating long-term engraftment of these HSPCs in a biologically complex environment \\n(Figure 24). Additionally, CD123Del and CLL-1Del cells did not show statistically significant \\ndifferences in the proportion of nucleated cells, as measured by hCD45 or C235 positivity, \\ncompared to EP cells. Furthermore, (Figure 25) deletion of CD123 and CLL-1 did not appear to have \\nan impact on the presence of hematopoietic precursor cells or erythroid cells in mice compared to \\ncontrol. Finally, a multi-lineage leukocyte distribution analysis revealed that CD123 and CLL-1 \\ndeletion did not significantly alter the distribution of the various cell types tested (Figure 26). \\nFigure 24: eHSCs Lead to Reduced Surface Target Expression In Vivo \\n \\nSource: Company S-1 filing \\n \\n \\n \\nPage 23\\nwww.wedbush.com\\n \\nFigure 25: eHSCs Have No Impact on Presence of Hematopoietic Precursor Cells or Erythroid Cells \\n \\nSource: Company S-1 filing \\n \\nFigure 26: Loss of CD123 and CLL-1 Antigens Do Not Substantially Alter Leukocyte Distribution \\n \\nSource: Company S-1 filing \\n \\nFuture Indications \\nOutside of the previously mentioned indications of AML, MDS and MPN, VOR has identified a \\nnumber of diseases, that based on its assessment of surface targets and therapeutic landscapes, \\npotentially make good expansion targets for its eHSC platform, including chronic lymphocytic \\nleukemia, multiple myeloma, and T and natural killer cell malignancies (Figure 27). \\n \\n \\n \\nPage 24\\nwww.wedbush.com\\n \\nFigure 27: Research Pipeline and Hematological Malignancies  \\nSource: Company S-1 filing \\nMultiplex Engineering: The VOR33-CLL1 + VCAR33-CLL1 Treatment System \\nWhile in its early preclinical stages, VOR is currently exploring multiplex edited eHSCs + multi-\\nspecific CAR-T therapies (VOR33-CLL1 + VCAR33-CLL1 treatment system) for the treatment of AML. \\nVOR believes that multi-specific companion therapeutics could potentially address tumor \\nheterogeneity or escape mechanisms where tumor cells down-regulate target expression. One \\nparticular risk of multiplex gene editing is the occurrence of chromosomal translocations. In order \\nto reduce the risk of translocation errors, VOR conducted preclinical studies using different \\nmultiplex engineering techniques to modify HSCs, including sequential Cas9 editing and base \\nediting. Both multiplex editing strategies resulted in highly efficient double knock-out of CD33 and \\nCLL-1 (Figure 28). Importantly, sequentially edited cells and base edited cells had a significant \\nreduction in translocation frequency compared to simultaneously edited cells (Figure 29). At EHA \\n2022, VOR presented additional preclinical data demonstrating that in addition to high levels of \\nediting and minimal translocation risk, CRISPR/Cas9 multiplex edited human CD34+ HSPCs with \\nCD33 and CLL-1 DKO maintained in vitro myeloid differentiation (Figure 30) and cellular function \\n(Figure 31). In vivo, the multiplex edited cells demonstrated long-term engraftment and \\nmultilineage reconstitution (Figure 32). \\nIn another in vitro experiment, VOR compared the survival of WT, CD33Del, CLL-1Del and \\nCD33Del+CLL-1Del cell lines when simultaneously exposed to CD33 and CLL-1 CAR-T therapies. \\nCD33Del+CLL-1Del cells had the highest survival rate, while cells with CAR-T targets removed had \\nstatistically significantly higher survival compared to control (Figure 33). \\nPage 25\\nwww.wedbush.com\\n \\nFigure 28: Multiplex-Engineering Strategies Achieve Highly Efficient Double Knock-out \\n \\nSource: Company S-1 filing \\n \\nFigure 29: Reduction in Translocation Frequency with Multiplex-Engineering Techniques \\n \\nSource: Company data \\n \\nPage 26\\nwww.wedbush.com\\n \\nFigure 30: CD33 and CLL-1 Multiplex Edited hHSPCs Maintain Myeloid Differentiation In Vitro \\n \\nSource: Company data, EHA 2022 \\n \\nFigure 31: In Vitro Myeloid Differentiated Cells Derived from CD33 and CLL-1 Multiplex Edited \\nhHSPCs Maintain Function \\n \\n \\nSource: Company data, EHA 2022 \\n \\nPage 27\\nwww.wedbush.com\\n \\nFigure 32: CD33 and CLL-1 MPX-edited hHSPCs Maintain Long-term Engraftment and \\nMultilineage Differentiation In Vivo \\n \\nSource: Company data, EHA 2022 \\n \\nFigure 33: Multiplex Editing Results in Protection from CAR-T Cytotoxicity \\n \\nSource: Company data, EHA 2022 \\n \\nCompetition \\n \\nWhile VOR33 is the only eHSC product candidate actively being developed with the purpose of \\nreducing on-target toxicity of targeted cancer medicines, Tmunity Therapeutics (private) has \\nlicensed intellectual property related to this approach from the University of Pennsylvania. In \\naddition, there are a number of anti-CD33 therapies for AML being developed that attempt to \\nreduce on-target toxicities by improving target specificity including Janssen’s (JNJ, not covered) \\nanti-CD33 bispecific antibody, JNJ-67571244. Importantly, we believe that VOR’s ability to rapidly \\nmanufacture VOR33 provides it with an important advantage over other gene edited cell therapy \\napproaches. With a cell engineering time of ~3 days, and a vein-to-vein time of 7-10 days, VOR’s \\nquick manufacturing timeline enables VOR33 to better integrate into current transplant practices. \\nBy comparison, standard manufacturing times for autologous gene engineered HSCs range from 7 \\nto 14 days, with a vein-to-vein times ranging from 21 to 35 days. Manufacturing times for \\nautologous CAR-T therapies can be even longer, with turnaround times ranging from 7 to 21 days, \\nand the patient potentially having to wait up to 42 days to receive treatment. We believe VOR’s \\nhighly efficient eHSC manufacturing approach provides it with a significant advantage when timely \\ntreatments are needed for patients with rapidly progressing diseases such as AML. \\nAs for VCAR33, while there are no approved CAR-T therapies for the treatment of \\nrelapsed/refractory AML, there are a number of companies with competing CAR-T therapies in \\nPage 28\\nwww.wedbush.com\\n \\npreclinical or early clinical development. Precigen (PGEN, not covered) is developing an autologous \\nCD33 targeted CAR-T (PRGN-3006) that includes a kill switch. 2seventy bio (TSVT, OUTPERFORM) \\nalso has an autologous, drug-regulated (rapamycin), anti-CD33 T-cell program, SC-DARIC33, which \\nis currently being evaluated in the ongoing Ph 1 PLAT-08 study for pediatric AML. The ability to \\ncycle between on and off states could allow for hematopoietic recovery, prevent T-cell exhaustion, \\nand encourage memory T-cell formation. Preclinical data for SC-DARIC33 showed potent \\nrapamycin dependent anti-leukemic activity in murine xenograft models. Looking further ahead, \\nTSVT is developing a next-generation DARIC33, which utilizes a dual-targeted approach to block \\ntumor escape routes and extend activity across disease subtypes. We expect initial data from the \\nPLAT-08 study in 2H22. Additionally, CRISPR Therapeutics (CRSP, not covered) has an allogeneic \\nCD33 targeted CAR-T program in preclinical development. Preclinical data for CRISPR-CAR33-1 CAR \\nT cells showed potent and specific killing of CD33 expressing AML cell lines in vitro, as well as robust \\nanti-tumor efficacy in THP-1 xenograft mouse models. Avencell (private) is developing a CD33 \\ntargeted T cell engaging bispecific antibody, which is currently in a Ph 1 trial. We believe that \\npositive response rates from CD33 directed cell therapies would support VOR’s strategy, with \\nVOR’s potential advantage in vein-to-vein time and more straightforward “fit” into transplant \\npractice providing advantages.  \\nMustang Bio (MBIO, not covered), Cellectis (CLLS, not covered), and Avencell have CD123 targeted \\nCAR-T candidates in ongoing Ph 1 studies. MBIO’s MB-102 and Avencell’s UniCAR-T-CD123 are \\nautologous, while CLLS’ UCART123 is an allogeneic CAR-T. First cohort data from Avencell showed \\na PR and two CRi’s in the first 3 patients dosed (Wermke et al., 2021). Kite Pharma, a Gilead \\ncompany (GILD, not covered), has an ongoing Ph 1 study evaluating its autologous CLL-1 targeted \\nCAR-T therapy. Furthermore, iCell Gene Therapeutics (Private) is developing a multi-specific CAR-\\nT (ICG-144) targeting CD33 and CLL-1. Initial first-in-human data showed complete response and \\nhaplo-HSCT engraftment in both patients without myeloablative conditioning. Furthermore, \\nIntellia Therapeutics (NTLA, Neutral) has an ex vivo CRISPR/Cas9 engineered, Wilms’ Tumor 1 \\n(WT1) targeting TCR-T cell candidate in an ongoing Ph 1/2a study for r/r AML patients.

FATE \\n(OUTPERFORM) has two NK cell therapies, FT516 and FT538, in ongoing Ph 1 monotherapy studies \\nin r/r AML. Interim Ph 1 results included data from 9 FT516 patients and 3 FT538 patients. 42% \\n(5/12) patients achieved an objective response with complete leukemic blast clearance in the \\nmarrow. Durable remissions of over 6 months were achieved in 2 FT516 patients. FT516 and FT538 \\nwere well tolerated, with no DLTs and no incidences of CRS, ICANS or GvHD. FATE will report \\nupdated data from these programs in 2H22.  \\n \\nCelularity (CELU, not covered) is developing an unmodified, placental-derived NK cell therapy, \\nCYNK-001, which is currently in a Ph 1/2 trial for r/r AML. CELU presented updated data from the \\nstudy showing that deeper lymphodepletion with CY/Flu enhanced short-term serum IL-15 levels \\nand reduced Treg levels well below baseline for more than 21 days. The company also highlighted \\npotential evidence of a dose effect of CYNK-001 in patients with r/r AML and reported one CR-post \\nallo-HSCT at day 120 (5.4 billion cells) and one CR with incomplete platelet recovery at day 28 \\n(700M cells). \\n \\nSenti Biosciences (private) has a logic gated (FLT3-or-CD33-not EMCN) CAR-NK product that, \\nsimilarly to the VOR33/VCAR33 treatment system, is designed to destroy AML cells while sparing \\nhealthy cells. Preclinical data presented at ASH 2021 demonstrated that SENTI-202 cells induced \\n47% protection of healthy HSCs relative to equivalent CAR-NK cells without the EMCN NOT gate. \\nSENTI-202 also demonstrated enhanced cytotoxicity over more traditional FLT3 or CD33 single CAR \\napproaches across multiple cell lines, and robust antitumor efficacy in AML xeno-transplant \\nmodels. A first-in-human trial should begin shortly, with initial data expected in 2022.

Since its approval in AML in November 2018, Venclexta-based \\ncombinations have been adopted as the new standard of care for AML patients who are not \\nsuitable for intense chemotherapy (Stahl et. al, 2021). Venclexta is a selective inhibitor of the anti-\\napoptotic protein B-cell lymphoma 2 (BCL-2) that is indicated in combination with azacitidine or \\ndecitabine or low-dose cytarabine for the treatment of newly-diagnosed AML. This indication was \\napproved under accelerated approval based on response rates from two studies. The primary \\nendpoint of the VIALE-A trial was based on overall survival, with key secondary endpoint of \\ncomplete remissions. Patients treated with a combination regimen of Venetoclax + Azacitidine had \\na median OS of 14.7 months compared to 9.6 months for patients treated with Azacitidine alone \\n(HR=0.66, P<0.001). 37% (25/67) of patients who received Venetoclax + Azacitidine achieved CRs \\nas defined by an absolute neutrophil count of >1,000/microliter, platelets of >100,000/microliter, \\nred blood cell transfusion independence, and bone marrow with <5% blasts. In the M14-358 trial \\n54% (7/13) of patients who received Venetoclax + Decitabine achieved CRs. The median time in \\nremission for the Venetoclax + Azacitidine cohort was 5.5 months (range 0.4 to 30 months) and \\nthe median time in remission for the Venetoclax + Decitabine cohort was 4.7 months (range 1 to \\n18 months). 7.5% (5/57) of patients treated with Venclexta + azacitidine subsequently received \\nstem cell transplant. An additional 35 patients who did not have known comorbidities preventing \\nthe use of intensive chemotherapy were enrolled in the study (Venclexta + azacytidine: n=17, \\nVenclexta + decitabine: n=18). In this patient subpopulation, the Venclexta + azacitidine cohort \\nexperienced a 35% CR rate, with 41% (7/17) of patients subsequently receiving stem cell \\ntransplant, and the Venclexta + decitabine cohort achieved a 56% CR rate, with 17% (3/18) of \\npatients subsequently receiving stem cell transplant.  \\n \\nVenclexta was also evaluated in combination with low dose cytarabine in the Ph 1b/2 M14-387 \\nstudy in treatment naïve AML patients. Venclexta + LDAC did not significantly improve OS vs LDAC. \\n21% (13/61) of patients achieved complete remission with partial hematological recover (CRh). For \\npatients who achieved a CR, the median time in remission was 6 months (range 0.03 to 25 months). \\nIn an additional 21 patients who did not have known comorbidities preventing the use of intensive \\nchemotherapy, 33% (7/21) achieved a CR, and 24% (5/21) achieved a CRh. 1 (5%) patient in this \\nsubpopulation subsequently received a stem cell transplant. Although not yet approved, \\nvenetoclax combination therapy is now being frequently used off-label in relapsed/refractory \\nsetting. In a retrospective study conducted by the Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center \\n(MSKCC), 12/86 r/r AML patients treated with venetoclax and a combination of either azacitidine, \\ndecitabine or low-dose cytarabine, achieved CR. 45% of patients who achieved a response to \\ntherapy relapsed, and the median duration of response for responders was 7.8 months. \\n \\nOther targeted therapies that are approved for the treatment of AML include Bristol-Meyers \\nSquibb’s (BMY, not covered) enasidenib (IDH-2 inhibitor), Agios Pharmaceuticals’ (AGIO, not \\ncovered) ivosidenib, Novartis’ (NVS, not covered) midostaurin, and Astella Pharma’s (ALPMY, not \\ncovered) gilteritinib.

There \\nare currently 12,000 allogeneic HSCTs performed globally each year for AML, with ~3,500 in the \\nUS, 7,000 in Europe, and 1,500 in Japan. We assume that VOR33 will become the standard of care \\nin HSCT for AML and model a peak penetration rate of 50% in the U.S., 20% in Europe, and 15% in \\nJapan. We assume a list price of $450,000, and model a competitive discount to US prices for \\nVOR33 in Europe and Japan. We estimate initial product launch in 1Q26 in the US and 3Q26 for \\nROW, and model global sales of ~$1.2 billion in 2030 (Figure 38).

In \\nthe bridge-to-transplant setting, we assume that approximately 40% of the 12,000 patients that \\nreceive allogeneic HSCT every year will relapse. Out of these 4,800 patients eligible for a bridge-\\nto-transplant therapy, we apply a ~20% peak penetration rate. We assume a list price of $300,000 \\nand model a competitive discount to US prices for VCAR33 in Europe and Japan. We estimate initial \\nproduct launch in 1Q27 in the US and 3Q27 in Europe and Japan, and model global sales for \\nVCAR33 in the AML bridge-to-transplant setting of ~$410MM in 2031 (Figure 39). Applying an 8x \\nmultiple to 2031E sales and discounting back annually by 40%, we arrive at a per share value of \\n~$2 for VCAR33 in the bridge-to-transplant setting. \\n \\nWe see a bigger opportunity for VCAR33 as part of a treatment system in combination with VOR33. \\nIn this setting, we estimate that all ~12,000 AML patients that receive allogeneic HSCT are eligible \\nto receive VCAR33, to which we apply 50%/30%/25% peak penetration rates in the U.S., Europe, \\nand Japan, respectively. We estimate initial product launch in 1Q28 in the US and 3Q28 in Europe \\nand Japan, and model global sales for VCAR33 of ~$906MM in 2031. Applying an 8x multiple to \\n2031E sales and discounting back annually by 40%, we arrive at a per share value of ~$5 for VCAR33 \\nin the combination setting. Overall, we estimate an ~$8 per share value for VCAR33. \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n$0\\n$500,000\\n$1,000,000\\n$1,500,000\\n$2,000,000\\n$2,500,000\\n2026\\n2027\\n2028\\n2029\\n2030\\n2031\\n2032\\n2033\\n2034\\n2035\\nUS\\nEU\\nJapan\\nPage 36\\nwww.wedbush.com\\n \\nFigure 39: Projected Sales of VCAR33 \\n \\nSource: Wedbush estimates \\n \\nFinancial position \\n \\nVOR ended 1Q22 with $182MM of cash, cash equivalents and investments, which management \\nbelieves is sufficient to fund operations through 4Q23. \\n \\nValuation \\n \\nInitiating coverage with an OUTPERFORM rating and an $18 price target.

foreign \\npatent applications and 18 pending U.S. provisional patent application. Licensed patents include 4 \\ngranted U.S. patents and 31 pending patent applications in the U.S. and abroad.  \\n \\nLicensing Agreements \\n \\nColumbia University \\nVOR entered into an exclusive license agreement with Columbia in April 2016 (amended in \\nFebruary 2019) and obtained worldwide rights to develop, manufacture and commercialize \\nproducts covered by the patents. Under the agreement, VOR paid Columbia an upfront cash \\npayment of $25,000 and issued to Columbia 91,911 shares of its common stock. VOR is obligated \\nto pay Columbia an annual fee in the low 5 digits, as well as tiered royalties in the low single digits \\non net sales of products that are covered by the licensed patents. VOR is also required to pay \\nroyalties in the low single digits on net sales of products that are not covered by licensed patents \\nbut involve the use of licensed know-how or materials. Additionally, VOR is required to pay up to \\nan aggregate of $4.45MM for certain clinical, regulatory and commercial milestones for the first 2 \\nproducts and a mid-second decile percentage of consideration received from sublicensees.   \\n \\nNational Institutes of Health - National Cancer Institute (NCI) \\nVOR entered into an agreement with NCI in October 2020 to exclusively license intellectual \\nproperty rights to develop, manufacture and commercialize licensed products (VCAR33), or \\npractice licensed processes to develop a lentiviral delivered, monospecific CD33 (Hu195 or hP67.7 \\nbinding domains) targeted CAR therapy for the treatment of CD33-expressing hematological \\nmalignancies. In connection with the agreement, VOR paid NCI a license issue fee of $400,000. \\nVOR is obligated to pay NCI de minimis minimum annual royalties, which are creditable against \\nearned royalties on sales of licensed products or licensed processes. VOR is also required to pay \\ntiered royalties in the low single-digits on net sales of licensed products if the product CAR-T cells \\nare delivered autologously, and tiered royalties at a higher range of low single digit rates if the \\nproduct CAR-T cells are delivered allogeneically. VOR is also obligated to pay NCI one-time \\nmilestone clinical and regulatory payments up to $8MM in the aggregate, as well as up to $6MM \\nin sales milestones. Should VOR sublicense the patents, it will pay low single-digit to low double-\\ndigit percentages of non-royalty based consideration received from the sublicensee. \\n \\nManufacturing and Supply \\n \\nVOR currently relies on third-party contract manufacturers for the production of its product \\ncandidates and expects to rely on contract manufacturing organizations (CMOs) for its clinical \\ntrials. The company has recently begun constructing a 43,500 square foot cGMP manufacturing \\nfacility to be added to its headquarters in Cambridge, Massachusetts. The fully integrated \\nmanufacturing facility will support clinical manufacturing for VOR’s eHSC and CAR-T drug products, \\nand is expected to be operational in 2022. \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\nPage 39\\nwww.wedbush.com\\n \\nManagement \\n \\nRobert Ang, M.B.B.S. \\nChief Executive Officer \\nDr. Ang joined VOR as its Chief Executive Officer in August 2019.

We’ll be keeping an eye out for the long-term \\n6mo data and potential for retreatment among patients who \\nrecurred on CP101 in the main study; c. diff could be a sizeable \\nopportunity for FNCH. \\nMCRB’s recent UC results were a setback for the field though \\nthere are important differences between approaches and \\nwe’re still learning where the microbiome will have effect \\nbeyond c. diff – though potential opportunities are vast. FNCH’s \\nown UC program is partnered with Takeda which recently \\naccelerated its leadership role in FIN-524 and will now assume \\nprimary responsibility for the program.  \\nFNCH’s wholly-owned pipeline is advancing as well; P1 autism \\ndata are expected 2H22 – the unmet need here is substantial \\nwith intriguing mechanistic rationale as well as early data for \\nFMT.

Covered companies are included or not included as holdings in the analyst\\'s Model Portfolio, and have \\nthe following ratings:\\nLong- the stock is a positive holding in the model portfolio; the total forecasted return is expected to be greater than 0%. \\nShort- the stock is a negative holding in the model portfolio; the total forecasted return is expected to be less than 0%. \\nNo Position- the stock is not included in the model portfolio.\\nCoverage Suspended- the rating and target price have been removed pursuant to Evercore lSI policy when Evercore is acting in an advisory \\ncapacity in a merger or strategic transaction involving this company, and in certain other circumstances; a stock in the model portfolio is removed. \\nRating Suspended - Evercore lSI has suspended the rating and/or target price for this stock because there is not sufficient fundamental basis for \\ndetermining, or there are legal, regulatory or policy constraints around publishing, a rating or target price. The previous rating and target price, if \\nany, are no longer in effect for this company and should not be relied upon; a stock in the model portfolio is removed.\\nStocks included in the model portfolio will be weighted from 0 to 100% for Long and 0 to -100% for Short. A stock\\'s weight in the portfolio reflects \\nthe analyst\\'s degree of conviction in the stock\\'s rating relative to other stocks in the portfolio. The model portfolio may also include a cash \\ncomponent. At any given time the aggregate weight of the stocks included in the portfolio and the cash component must equal100%.\\nStocks assigned ratings under the alternative model portfolio-based coverage system cannot also be rated by Evercore lSI\\'s Current Ratings \\ndefinitions of Outperform, In Line and Underperform.\\nFlNRA requires that members who use a ratings system with terms other than \"Buy,\" \"Hold/Neutral\" and \"Sell,\" to equate their own \\nratings to these categories.

GRNA has developed a low-cost, cell-free method of RNA\\nproduction for agricultural products in Plant and Animal Health, and is now leveraging\\nthat technology for vaccines and other Human Health programs. In our view, by\\nenabling a sub-$1 per gram RNA cost compared to as much as $100 per gram for in\\nvitro transcription (IVT) systems, GRNA’s proprietary cell-free RNA manufacturing\\nprocess opens previously cost-prohibitive commercial opportunities. Consequently, we\\nsee the company democratizing the use of RNA solutions for some of the world’s most\\nacute challenges, including climate change, food insecurity, and global pandemics of\\nincreasing frequency.\\nIn Plant and Animal Health, GRNA has a pipeline of seven biological products with a total\\naddressable market that the company estimates at $6 billion in 2026, and another six\\nthrough 2028 and beyond, with a combined estimated TAM by 2028 of nearly $10B. We\\nbelieve that efficacy of GRNA’s crop protection and animal health solutions could prove\\nto be substantially better than that of incumbent biological crop protection products.\\nThe publication of this report comes on the heels of Canaccord Genuity's AgriFood Tech\\nInnovation Virtual Forum held last week, where an emerging generation of agricultural\\nbiologics with greater efficacy was a central topic.\\nIn Human Health, GRNA plans to hit several important clinical milestones through\\n2026, including initiating Phase I/II clinical trials for a COVID-19 vaccine and candidate\\nselection for a shingles vaccine in partnership with Serum Institute of India.\\nWhile revenue opportunities appear abundant across GRNA’s key markets, we are taking\\na conservative approach to forecasting and valuation, setting a $4 price target based\\non a probability-weighted DCF and a sum-of-the-parts analysis, the bulk of which is\\ndriven by Plant and Animal Health ($3 of $4 PT). While GRNA’s Human Health program\\nis in its early stages and in need of additional clarity on the clinical path forward, we\\nare attributing $1 of our price target to this part of the platform. This equates to ~$150\\nmillion and is a top-down estimate based primarily on market potential for GRNA’s novel\\ntechnology. We note there is potential for additional value creation as clinical milestones\\nare achieved. In our view, this approach somewhat de-risks the assumptions underlying\\nour DCF while assigning more credit to programs with a longer history. However, we\\nbelieve that even moderate success on GRNA’s Human Health opportunity could drive\\nsubstantial upside to our expectations.\\nGreenLight Biosciences was founded in 2008 and is headquartered in Medford,\\nMassachusetts.

Using current in vitro \\ntranscription (IVT) systems, costs are prohibitively high, at roughly $100 per gram. \\nGRNA is leveraging a cell-free approach to enable low-cost dsRNA production at \\nscale for less than $1 per gram. Although originally developed for agricultural \\nsolutions, GRNA is leveraging its cell-free method into mRNA production for vaccines \\nand other Human Health programs. In this way, we see GRNA bringing the promise \\nof RNA-based solutions to markets where it has been prohibitively expensive, \\nincluding field-scale agriculture and vaccines for the developing world. \\nAgriculture offers significant TAMs across more than a dozen products \\nGRNA began as a biotech company focused on solutions exclusively for agriculture. \\nBroadly speaking, we believe RNAi crop protection solutions can capture meaningful \\nshare within the crop protection market over time. RNAi solutions may also be \\ncapable of addressing pest issues currently unsolvable through existing biological or \\nsynthetic solutions, enlarging the opportunity. Within agriculture (includes Plant and \\nAnimal Health), GRNA has thirteen products at various stages of development, \\nincluding a biological crop protection product for the Colorado potato beetle \\nscheduled for launch in 2023. Based on GRNA’s pipeline, we see a combined TAM of \\nroughly $10B from 13 products anticipated to launch through 2028 and beyond.  \\nGlobal challenges drive the need for GRNA’s low-cost RNA solutions \\nThe world is facing significant challenges likely to grow more acute in coming \\ndecades.

GRNA is focusing its \\nvaccine program on solutions for the developing world, as middle- and lower-income \\ncountries generally have lower vaccination rates and access. GRNA’s approach is to \\npartner with Samsung for volume manufacturing, and with companies in Africa, the \\nMiddle East, Asia, and Latin America, for widespread vaccination including booster \\nshots to address waning immunity and emerging variants.  \\n \\nCOVID program holds a few differentiators that could set it apart in a \\ncrowded field \\nGRNA’s lead Human Health program is an mRNA-based COVID vaccine. The \\nPfizer/BioNTech and Moderna COVID vaccines have thoroughly de-risked the \\napproach. However, these companies are expected to dominate the COVID booster \\nmarket for the foreseeable future.  \\nGRNA has three potential opportunities to advance the COVID vaccine paradigm \\nforward:  \\n1. \\nNo one has yet been able to generate a pan-coronavirus vaccine. And while \\nBioNTech (BNTX: NASDAQ: $162.63 | BUY) and others are working on a \\npan-coronavirus vaccine, GRNA is preparing to bring a sequence with \\nbroader SARS-CoV2 coverage into the clinic as early as next year. The \\nsequence was generated by the NIH with a mosaic-approach, displaying \\nsequence features common across novel strains. Features that have not yet \\nbeen mutated may be critical to the virus, and less likely to mutate around \\nvaccine surveillance.  \\n2. \\nGRNA is developing novel lipid nanoparticle (LNP) formulations. While initial \\nLNPs have done the trick in terms of generating safe and effective vaccines, \\nthere is some room to improve on the safety profile. Most notably, less \\ninflammatory lipids could lead to fewer adverse events.  \\n3. \\nThe company’s agricultural platform, where margins are tighter and scale is \\nlarger, has generated a manufacturing/scale-up focus that management \\nbelieves will result in large-scale manufacturing at lower COGS than the \\ncurrent producers. \\nWe acknowledge the highly competitive nature of the COVID vaccine market, but as \\nthe market shifts to a commercial instead of government-pay market, the multi-fold \\nincrease in revenue per shot is likely to support a still-healthy COVID booster \\nopportunity in coming years. While we have no indication that management is \\noriented toward licensing the technology, we think any incremental improvement in \\nthe way the currently marketed vaccines are produced would be valuable to Pfizer, \\nBioNTech, or Moderna.  \\nShingles vaccine takes aim at a less competitive – but equally validated – \\ncommercial market \\nIn March 2022, GRNA agreed with Serum Institute of India (SIIPL) to license up to \\nthree mRNA products outside the majority of the developed world. Shingles is the \\nfirst (and as-yet only) target selected to this point, with the others to be selected by \\nGreenLight Biosciences\\nInitiation of Coverage\\nBuy  Target Price US$4.00  | 8 December 2022\\nSustainability - Agriculture & Food Tech 7\\n \\n8 \\n \\nthe end of 2024. GRNA has an option to purchase the research and trial data in \\nexchange for half of the incurred expenses. There was a $5M upfront fee with up to \\n$17M in outstanding development, regulatory, and commercial milestones, and \\nSIIPL owes a mid-double-digit royalty on net sales. \\n \\nCompetitive positioning \\n \\nAs previously mentioned, GRNA is highly differentiated by its low-cost RNA production \\nmethod, which allows for RNA-based biological crop protection solutions at field scale. \\nThe company’s focus on developing vaccines for underserved parts of the world is \\nanother key distinction enabled by low-cost RNA production.  \\nBroad range of competitors across agriculture and human health \\nWe note that GRNA competes with a range of companies, some of whom are of \\nsubstantial scale, across its crop protection and vaccine businesses. In crop \\nprotection, several large companies dominate the market including Syngenta, Bayer \\nCrop Science, BASF, Corteva, and UPL Limited. In certain cases, GRNA could partner \\nwith one or more of these crop protection leaders, as is the case with GRNA’s \\ncurrent partnership with UPL. Competitors in Human Health include biotech \\ncompanies working on similar pipeline, mRNA companies, large pharmaceutical \\ncompanies, and academia. In vaccine and therapeutics, several large companies \\ndominate the market, including Roche Holding AG, AbbVie, GlaxoSmithKline (GSK), \\nMerck & Co Inc, Sanofi, Pfizer, AstraZeneca, Johnson & Johnson, and Novavax. RNA \\ncompanies such as BioNTech and Moderna already have COVID-19 vaccines on the \\nmarket, while CureVac N.V., Arcturus Therapeutics Inc., Translate Bio, Daiichi \\nSankyo, Elixirgen Therapeutics, and Providence Therapeutics have clinical trials \\nunderway. Additionally, GreenLight faces competition from specialized therapeutics \\ncompanies such as Alnylam Pharmaceuticals, Editas Medicine, and Dicerna \\nPharmaceuticals.  \\nSignificant manufacturing advantage \\nAs previously mentioned, GRNA’s cell-free manufacturing method produces RNA at \\ncosts well below the cost of in vitro approached (as little as 1/100th the cost). Cell-\\nfree production of GRNA’s agriculture products has several stages, with a critical \\ngoal being production of dsRNA without the costly encumbrance of gene-edited \\ncells. First, to make RNA building blocks, a depolymerization stage utilizes nuclease \\nenzymes to cleave off NMPs (ribonucleoside monophosphate) from microbial RNA. \\nThese building blocks are then fed into the cell-free production stage, where \\npolyphosphates provide energy, a DNA template provides instructions, and enzymes \\nact as catalysts. Finally, following the recovery stage, formulations can take place \\nbased on various product specifications. Using this process, GRNA manages to \\nproduce dsRNA that is approximately 50-65% pure for under $1 per gram and in \\n1,000-plus-liter batches. Final formulations remain stable for at least two years at \\n25 degrees Celsius, enabling quality RNA products that are easily deployed in an \\nagricultural setting. \\nGRNA’s bio-pesticides could alter crop protection landscape \\nRNAi based bio-pesticides offer several advantages to manufacturers and farmers. \\nForemost is their lighter treatment by regulators when compared to solutions \\nincorporated into a plant’s genome or based on synthetic chemicals. While RNAi bio-\\npesticides have been challenged finding a stable method of delivery to the target, \\ntheir gene silencing ability can be highly effective. An RNAi bio-pesticide can be \\ntailored to impact only the target pest and can deliver catastrophic consequences \\nwith only brief exposure if changing the expression of certain of its critical genes. \\nWhen compared to synthetic chemical pesticides, their development time is also \\nmuch shorter and potentially substantially less costly. While it is tempting to look at \\nthe RNAi bio-pesticides opportunity from the perspective of the current crop \\nprotection landscape, we note that the market relevance is theoretically much \\nGreenLight Biosciences\\nInitiation of Coverage\\nBuy  Target Price US$4.00  | 8 December 2022\\nSustainability - Agriculture & Food Tech 8\\n \\n9 \\n \\nbigger considering RNAi solutions could solve many of the negative aspects of \\nchemical crop protection and be more broadly deployed. Lastly, we note that \\nefficacy of RNAi crop protection solutions may prove to be substantially better than \\nthat of current biological crop protection products.  \\n \\nmRNA vaccine advantages \\nThere are several notable advantages to mRNA vaccines. When compared to other \\napproaches whose manufacturing processes may change the antigen, mRNA \\nvaccines can have increased quality of the immune response. This is because the \\nantigen expressed in an mRNA vaccine has a higher likelihood of being a true match \\nto the pathogen protein. Another advantage of mRNA vaccines is their shorter \\ndevelopment time from antigen selection to clinical trials. This rapid turnaround \\nmakes mRNA particularly suitable as epidemics emerge and for effective response to \\na pandemic. Importantly, different mRNA vaccines can be produced out of the same \\nmanufacturing plant. \\n \\nRNA vaccines for developing world \\nWhile current supply of COVID-19 vaccines is largely focused on wealthy nations, \\nGRNA is focused on leveraging its low-cost of RNA production to dramatically \\nincrease their availability in the developing world. Currently in the preclinical \\ndevelopment stage, GRNA is taking a partnership approach with companies in \\nregions likely to experience continuing shortages of vaccines, including Africa and \\nthe Middle East, South East Asia, South Asia, Latin America, and China.  \\n \\n \\nFinancial overview: projections currently weighted \\nto agriculture opportunity  \\n \\nGreenLight is pursuing a roughly $10 billion TAM for Plant and Animal Health, with an \\nanticipated full commercial launch of its first product in 2023 (Colorado potato beetle \\ntreatment). The company views its TAM as the global revenue opportunity available \\nfor pest control solutions. When it comes to quantifying each opportunity, GreenLight \\nbegins with defining an applicable active ingredient market for the intended products \\nthat the company is trying to market within the specific crop. After a relevant active \\ningredient market has been identified, it then assumes a percentage of that market \\nthat is spent on controlling the target pest or disease. Additionally, GreenLight utilizes \\ndata from AgBioinvestor, FAOSTAT (a database run by the Food and Agriculture \\nOrganization of the United Nations), and third-party consultants to quantify the \\nmarket and construct relevant assumptions.  \\nRobust pipeline with substantial TAMs \\nWithin its insecticides and acaricides program, the company is currently working on \\nsix projects (Colorado potato beetle, Varroa mites, diamondback moth, two-spotted \\nspider mite, pollen beetle, and fall armyworm). GRNA’s program to control Colorado \\npotato beetle (Calantha), with an anticipated TAM of $350 million, has been \\nsubmitted to the EPA for approval and is expected to become fully commercialized in \\n2023. The Varroa mites project has an anticipated TAM of $290 million and is \\nexpected to be submitted to the EPA in 2023. The company anticipates moving the \\ndiamondback moth program ($890 million in TAM) to a field trial in 2022 or 2023, \\nwith EPA submission in 2023 and the goal of a launch after 2026. In addition, GRNA \\naims to submit Two Spotted Spider Mite product ($1.1 billion in TAM) to the EPA for \\napproval in 2024.  \\nGRNA’s fungicides program currently has seven major targets (botrytis, powdery \\nmildew, Fusarium, vine downy mildew, Asian soybean rust, black Sigatoka and rise \\nblast). Botrytis ($1.2 billion in TAM) and powdery mildew ($1.4 billion in TAM) \\nGreenLight Biosciences\\nInitiation of Coverage\\nBuy  Target Price US$4.00  | 8 December 2022\\nSustainability - Agriculture & Food Tech 9\\n \\n10 \\n \\nprograms are currently going through a field trial and are expected to be submitted \\nto EPA in 2023 and launched by 2025. Additionally, GRNA expects to submit its \\nFusarium program ($950 million in TAM) to the EPA in 2023 and launch into the \\nmarket by 2026 at the earliest.  \\nConservative rate of penetration and probability weighting \\nWe assume revenue build will take anywhere between three and five years from \\nlaunch. At year five, each programs’ estimated revenue, except for Varroa mite, \\nwould range from 2% to 10% penetration within its respective current market TAM, \\naveraging roughly 6.5%. In its S-4/A, GRNA assumed its Varroa mite product would \\nachieve a significantly higher penetration rate of 35%. We note our DCF assumes \\nGRNA reaches $224 million in Plant and Animal Health product revenue by 2028, as \\nthe company begins to drive into its roughly $10bn market opportunity (we expect \\nadditional share gains in subsequent years). \\nWe also haircut our estimates for each of the programs through probability \\nweightings. To reflect varying degrees of uncertainty, we utilize a 40% probability \\nfor programs expected to launch beyond 2026 (pollen beetle, fall armyworm, Asian \\nsoybean rust, black Sigatoka, rice blast, and downy mildew), and higher \\nprobabilities for programs nearer to commercialization (80% probability for Colorado \\npotato beetle and 70% for Varroa mite). \\nHuman health contributes additional value  \\nGRNA plans to hit several important clinical milestones through 2026, including \\ninitiating Phase I/II clinical trials for a COVID-19 vaccine and candidate selection for \\na shingles vaccine in partnership with the Serum Institute of India.  \\n \\nNegligible revenue booked thus far \\nDuring 2020 and 2021, the company received approximately $3.3 million in grant \\nrevenue from the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation. The funds will be primarily used \\nfor the purpose of research for in-vivo gene therapy, as well as the exploration of \\nthe new, low-cost cure of sickle cell disease and/or durable suppression of HIV in \\ndeveloping countries.  \\n \\nModel overview: meaningful revenue several years out \\nYear to date as of Q3 FY2022, GRNA had recognized $3.4 million of revenue related \\nto the collaboration agreement with Serum Institute of India Private Limited (SIIPL) \\nfor the delivery of IP and research services. In Q4 of 2022, we are assuming GRNA \\nwill receive the remaining $1.6 million in Serum licensing agreement revenue (total \\nagreement revenue equals $5M). For FY2022 we are modeling a total of $5.3 million \\nin revenue. \\nIn FY2023, our model calls for $4.2 million in total revenue, primarily driven by the \\ncommercial launch of GRNA’s first product, Colorado potato beetle ($2.2 million in \\nrevenue in Q4E), as well as additional plant-health R&D collaboration revenue of $2 \\nmillion.  \\nFor FY2024, we expect to see $12.8 million in total revenue.

(ENVI) closed \\ntheir previously announced business combination transaction. As a result, the \\ncompany changed its name to GreenLight Biosciences Holdings, with shares of Class \\nA common stock and public warrants trading on NASDAQ under the ticker symbols \\nGRNA and GRNA.WS, respectively. Initially, the transaction was expected to \\ngenerate net cash proceeds of $282 million, inclusive of the $105 million PIPE and \\ncash held in trust. However, post transaction GRNA received gross proceeds of \\n$136.4 million, before deducting $26.7 million in fee expenses. The PIPE financing \\nresulted in gross proceeds of ~$124.3 million, of which $35.25 million was \\nadvanced to GRNA by the Prepaying PIPE Investors in December 2021 \\n GRNA exited Q3 FY2022 with $99.7 million in cash and cash equivalents (inclusive \\nof private placement raise) and $29.7 million in interest-bearing debt on its balance \\nsheet. Based on its current business plan, GRNA expects its cash runway to extend \\ninto 2H 2023. Going forward, in order to fund necessary development and \\ncommercialization activities through the forecast period, our model reflects an \\nadditional $200 million in hypothetical debt-based financing in Q4 of 2023 and \\n2024. As of Q3 2022, the company had 139 million of common shares outstanding \\nand 174.8 million shares on a fully diluted basis including options and warrants.  \\n \\nPrivate placement overview \\nOn August 11, GRNA sold approximately 27,844,383 shares of its common stock in \\na private placement to a select group of institutional and accredited investors for \\n$3.92 per share. As a result, the company received gross proceeds of approximately \\n$109 million ($106.3 million of net proceeds). GRNA will utilize the proceeds to \\nadvance its development of research and commercial programs, as well as for \\nworking capital and general corporate purposes. \\n \\nValuation \\nWe are setting a $4 price target based on our sum-of-the-parts analysis ($3 price \\nfor Animal and Plant Health and $1 for Human Health). While GRNA's RNA-based \\nplatform offers revenue opportunities across the plant, animal, and human health \\nmarkets, we are conservatively basing the bulk of our price target on Plant and \\nAnimal Health, where the company has demonstrated meaningful progress toward \\ncommercialization of several elements of its pipeline.  \\nWhile GRNA’s Human Health program is in its early stages and in need of additional \\nclarity on the clinical path forward, we are attributing $1 of our price target to this \\npart of the platform. This equates to ~$150M and is a top-down estimate based \\nprimarily on market potential for GRNA’s novel technology, and we note the \\npotential for additional value creation as clinical milestones are achieved. Our top-\\ndown value estimate stems from several directional value indicators across the \\nHuman Health market opportunity. \\nA look at the COVID program and value comps \\nWe see two ways to benchmark GRNA’s technology program: standalone programs \\nfor COVID vaccines and as improvements to existing programs. \\nAs a standalone program \\nAs a standalone program, GRNA would have to validate its technological \\nimprovements and validate the SARS-CoV2 sequence provided by the NIH to \\noffer broad coverage. The clinical/regulatory path forward is currently unclear. \\nAt the moment, GRNA intends to begin a Ph1 study of its original, Wuhan strain \\nvaccine in an ex-US country, demonstrating safety and paving the way for \\ndevelopment of its updated sequence vaccine in the US and other developed \\ncountries. As the COVID landscape continuously shifts, it is unclear what the \\nFDA or other regulatory agencies would need to see for approval or preferential \\nrecommendation. However, as we currently value BioNTech’s COVID vaccine at \\nFigure 8: FD shares \\n \\nSource: Company Reports \\nFigure 9: Implied share price \\n \\nSource: Canaccord Genuity estimates, share price \\nvalues are rounded to the nearest dollar \\nCommon Stock\\n139,061,906\\nOptions\\n23,401,859\\nWarrants\\n12,383,304\\nUnvested \\nTotal FD shares\\n174,847,069\\nPresent Value of Cash Flows\\n($381)\\nPresent Value of Terminal Value\\n$974\\nEnterprise Value\\n$592\\nPlus: Cash & Cash Equivalents\\n164\\nLess: Debt\\n(230)\\nPlant and Animal Health Equity Value\\n$526\\nHuman Health Equity Value\\n$150\\nDiluted Shares Outstanding\\n175\\nImplied Plant and Animal Health Share Price\\n$3\\nImplied Plant and Animal Health Share Price\\n$1\\nTotal Implied Share Price\\n$4\\nImplied Share Price\\nGreenLight Biosciences\\nInitiation of Coverage\\nBuy  Target Price US$4.00  | 8 December 2022\\nSustainability - Agriculture & Food Tech 12\\n \\n13 \\n \\n$23B (after a 50% profit share with Pfizer), even factoring the additional time to \\nmarket for GreenLight, we believe there remains significant underappreciated \\nvalue in the COVID vaccination market. \\nAs an improvement on existing technology \\nFor a comparable scenario, we note that in January 2022, Pfizer entered into a \\nnon-exclusive license for Acuitas’ LNP technology (which is used in the current \\nCOVID vaccine) for 10 new targets, for an undisclosed amount, and with Codex \\nfor an enzymatic DNA synthesis technology to speed template creation for its \\nmRNA vaccines and shorten time from sequence to commercial scale product by \\nnearly a month. We believe that deal could generate development and \\ncommercial milestones of >$100 million, illustrating the available value for even \\nincremental improvements in the current paradigm.  \\nValuing the shingles program \\nIn January 2022, Pfizer and BioNTech announced they would work together on an \\nmRNA-based shingles vaccine. Pfizer paid $75M upfront (plus a $150M equity \\ninvestment and milestones up to $200M) for a profit share. BioNTech paid back to \\nPfizer $25M for its share of the herpes zoster virus antigen sequences contributed to \\nthe collaboration. Based on the $75M upfront payment for a profit share, we \\nestimate an early-stage mRNA-based shingles vaccine program from a validated \\nplatform to be priced at $150M. We also note the upfront $5M payment from SIIPL \\nfor ex-developed country rights (plus milestones and royalties) as a nice validation \\nof the potential from GRNA, and believe that if it shows potential for success in \\ndeveloped countries, there is significantly more value. GSK’s market-leading \\nshingles vaccine Shingrix surpassed £2B in sales in peak year 2020 (2021 was lower \\ndue to COVID vaccines complicating vaccination schedules) after launching in 2017. \\nWhile setting a high bar (~90% effective at preventing shingles and postherpetic \\nneuralgia, the most common complication of shingles), Shingrix also carries painful \\nside effects, leaving room for competitors to improve. There is also potential upside \\nfrom royalties in the developing world, which has low rates of shingles vaccination. \\nmRNA technology is highly adaptable \\nGRNA has additional pipeline programs, including vaccines, that have been \\ndeprioritized as the company seeks to properly support its two lead programs. As \\ndemonstrated by investments from both Moderna and BioNTech (/Pfizer) in more \\nmRNA vaccine programs beyond flu and shingles, mRNA vaccine technology has the \\npotential to advance infectious disease vaccines. Management has previously \\ndescribed plans to address sickle cell disease via gene therapy. Cancer vaccines are \\nalso areas that others are pursuing, and while GRNA has not detailed cancer vaccine \\nplans, it is an option for the technology (Merck recently paid Moderna $250M to opt \\ninto its cancer vaccine program). Based on the potential in these programs and the \\nbroad adaptability of the platform, we are estimating a $150M total value for the \\nHuman Health business overall, or $1/sh. \\nSum-of-the-parts and DCF overview \\nOur discounted cash flow analysis on the Plant and Animal Health pipeline yields $3 \\nof our $4 price target, and uses a 10% WACC, a 21% tax rate, and a 2% terminal \\ngrowth rate. To arrive at $1 for Human Health, we rely on a top-down value \\nestimate based primarily on market potential for GRNA’s novel technology.  \\nComparable company analysis \\nBased on GRNA’s differentiated business model, we have identified several \\nindustries in our comp table: ag tech companies, revenue-generating human health \\nbiotech companies, synthetic biology companies, and companies that went public \\nvia a SPAC transaction. GRNA has an anticipated 100.3% 3-year revenue CAGR \\nthrough 2024 (starting off a lower base) versus 7.2% average for agtech peers. \\nWhen looking at revenue-generating human health biotech peers, they are trading \\nat a 6.4x EV/sales on a 2024E; while synthetic biology and SPAC companies are \\ntrading at 2.5x and 3x EV/sales on 2024E, respectively.  \\nGreenLight Biosciences\\nInitiation of Coverage\\nBuy  Target Price US$4.00  | 8 December 2022\\nSustainability -

(NASDAQ: ENVI), in a deal that netted a \\npro forma equity value of $1.2 billion. The transaction was expected to generate net \\ncash proceeds of $282 million, inclusive of the $105 million PIPE and cash held in \\ntrust. We note that ENVI is sponsored by CG Investments Inc. VI, an affiliate of \\nCanaccord Genuity, which manages several investment vehicles. \\nThe PIPE investor base was made up of the following companies: Serum Life \\nSciences, Fall Line Capital, Viceroy Capital, S2G Ventures, Cormorant Asset \\nManagement, Morningside Venture Investments, Hudson Bay Capital, BNP Paribas \\nEcosystem Restoration Fund, The Jeremy and Hannelore Grantham Environmental \\nTrust, Continental Grain Company, Pura Vida Investments LLC, Xeraya Capital, and \\nMLS Fund II/Spruce.  \\nFollowing the successful shareholder approval vote on February 2, 2022, GreenLight \\nBiosciences and ENVI closed the transaction with 80.7% of shareholders \\nparticipating in the vote and 78.6% voting in favor. As a result, the company \\nchanged its name to GreenLight Biosciences Holdings, with shares of Class A \\ncommon stock and public warrants trading on NASDAQ under the ticker symbols \\nGRNA and GRNA.WS, respectively. Additionally, as of the close of the transaction, \\nGreenLight’s directors, executive officers, and affiliates held ~85% of the \\noutstanding shares of GRNA’s common stock, and the former shareholders of ENVI \\nheld ~5% of the outstanding shares. \\nGRNA generated approximately $136.4 million in gross proceeds, of which $12.1 \\nmillion (post redemptions) were the funds held in trust. The PIPE financing resulted \\nin gross proceeds of ~$124.3 million, of which $35.25 million was advanced to \\nGRNA by the prepaying PIPE investors in December 2021. Transaction costs totaled \\n$26.7 million. As of February 2, 2022, the company had 122.8 million of common \\nshares outstanding and 153.4 million shares on a fully diluted basis including \\noptions and warrants.  \\n \\n \\nOperational overview  \\nThe company’s primary facilities are in the metropolitan area in Boston, \\nMassachusetts; Rochester, New York; and Durham, North Carolina; each of which is \\nleased. GRNA’s corporate headquarters are based in Medford, Massachusetts, where \\na total of approximately 50,000 square feet are leased for office and laboratory use.  \\n \\nLow-cost RNA production technology  \\nAs previously mentioned, GRNA’s cell-free manufacturing method produces RNA at \\ncosts well below that of in vitro methods (as little as 1/100th the cost). Cell-free \\nproduction of GRNA’s agriculture products has several stages with a critical goal \\nbeing production of dsRNA without the costly encumbrance of gene-edited cells. \\nFirst, to make RNA building blocks, a Depolymerization Stage utilizes nuclease \\nenzymes to cleave off NMPs (ribonucleoside monophosphate) from microbial RNA. \\nThese building blocks are then fed into the Cell-Free Production Stage, where \\npolyphosphates provide energy, a DNA template provides instructions, and enzymes \\nact as catalysts. Finally, following the Recovery Stage, formulations can take place \\nbased on various product specifications. Using this process, GRNA manages to \\nproduce dsRNA that is approximately 50-65% pure for under $1 per gram and in \\n1,000 plus liter batches.

The facility also houses \\nlaboratories for development and analytical functions and has a loading dock. The \\nfacility is currently operated by a staff of 15 technicians, process engineers, \\nresearch associates, and quality control personnel, all working to achieve \\ncommercial production of plant health products.  \\n \\nDuring Q3/21, the company increased the facility’s production capacity up to 2,000 \\nliters per batch following installation of a single bioreactor, with zero impact on \\nprocess yields or quality. GRNA estimates that with its Rochester facility it can \\ncurrently produce approximately 500 kg of dsRNA on an annual basis. With its two \\n2,000-liter bioreactors, the company estimates that its manufacturing capacity is \\nable to provide up to approximately 1,000 kg of dsRNA on an annual basis. The \\ncompany is expected to meet its needs for agricultural products through the middle \\nof 2024, pending various regulatory approvals needed to commercialize products in \\nthe agricultural product pipeline. GRNA is currently working on another expansion of \\nthe facility in Rochester, with plans to further boost manufacturing capacity of \\ndsRNA for agricultural use, noting the recent leasing of an additional 5,577 square \\nfeet of laboratory space and 4,669 square feet for storage for this added capacity.  \\n \\nGreenhouse and laboratory for agriculture use \\nIn addition to its manufacturing facilities, the company leases approximately 14,000 \\nsquare feet of office, greenhouse, and laboratory space for its agricultural \\noperations based in Durham, North Carolina.

We believe growth for environmentally sustainable crop \\nprotection products like bio-pesticides is proceeding at a much faster pace, perhaps \\nin the mid-teens range. We see GRNA’s solutions falling into this high-growth \\ncategory.  \\nThe concept of crop protection has remained an integral part of the production of \\nfood, with innovation following demand over the millennia and population increases \\noccurring following events like the industrial revolution, which drove even more \\nsophisticated approaches to the practice. In roughly 1200 BC, communities in China \\nbegan the use of arsenic as a way to control for body lice, and in 500 BC the \\npractices of water irrigation, fertilization, and crop rotation began to emerge. By \\napproximately 1 AD, the Greeks and Romans had begun leveraging smoked tar, \\nsalt, and plant extracts to control for diseases, weeds, and insects, while in Persia \\ncommunities began using pyrethrum. Roughly around 1100 AD was when Crusaders \\nbegan to utilize pyrethrum against body lice and brought the technology back to \\nEurope.  \\nCenturies later in 1800, Pierre Millardet discovered the Bordeaux mixture which \\nconsisted of lime and CuSO4. By the 1900s, coal gas production materials began to \\nbe used for disease and insect control, while sodium arsenate and ammonium \\nsulphate were deployed as herbicides. During the 1940s, the first synthetic \\npesticides were introduced, including DDT in 1940 followed by the first recorded \\nresistance to DDT in 1945. In 1962, Rachel Carson published her book titled Silent \\nSpring, ushering in an increased focus on reducing adverse effects brought on by \\npesticide use. 1974 saw the registration of glyphosate as a tool for crop protection, \\nand the 1980s saw what is referred to as the “Golden Age” of new modes of \\napplication including products that were biologically derived. The 1990s witnessed \\nthe first commercialization of GMO crops as well as several noteworthy launches of \\nnew, naturally occurring compounds for MOAs. The rate of introduction for new \\nMOAs continued to decline into the 2000s, with the exception of the launch of \\ndiamides.  \\nThe United Nations (UN) and United States Census Bureau have noted that during \\nthis timeframe, the global population surged from roughly 5 million people at the \\ndawn of agriculture in 8000 BC to over 8 billion people in 2022 AD. We believe \\nGRNA’s biological crop protection product pipeline (and honeybee protection) will \\nhelp address some of the sustainability challenges posed by the next stage in \\npopulation growth.  \\nFavorable conditions for an innovative take on crop protection solutions \\nBoth farmers and consumers have been demanding innovation from the crop \\nprotection market, though there has been a noticeable lack of innovation in the \\nspace, with data from CropLife America highlighting how between the 1960s and \\n1990s there were hundreds of herbicides, insecticides, fungicides, and more \\nintroduced to the market, while the 2000s recorded just above 100 new product \\nintroductions, and only about 40 product introductions in the 2010s. \\nOver recent decades, a diminishing set of acceptable and effective crop health \\nproducts has resulted in what are often referred to as the “3 R’s” of resistance, \\nresidues, and regulations, creating real demand among farmers and consumers for \\ninnovative product offerings. Between 1920 and the 2010s, insects, weeds, fungi, \\nand GMO crops have each steadily observed rising numbers of unique cases of \\nresistance, according to the Insect Resistance Action Committee. Consumers have \\nalso continued to indicate that pesticide residues are a primary food safety concern, \\nand between the 1970s and 2010s there have been an increasing number of \\nvoluntarily cancelled pesticides on the market, according to data from \\nFigure 17: Potato 2020 field trials \\n \\nSource: Company reports \\nGreenLight Biosciences\\nInitiation of Coverage\\nBuy  Target Price US$4.00  | 8 December 2022\\nSustainability - Agriculture & Food Tech 18\\n \\n19 \\n \\nEnvironmental Health and the International Food Information Council. RNA-based \\nsolutions like those being developed by GRNA can address these issues and would \\nprovide a new mode of action for growers. They degrade quickly while leaving little \\nto no residue and boast a favorable regulatory profile due to their lower toxicity and \\nprecise, targeted design.  \\nThe problem of resistance \\nWhile precise figures are unavailable, farmers incur significant losses from pesticide \\nresistance every year, with hundreds of arthropod species resistant to a broad range \\nof chemicals. Various paths to resistance can be taken. Insects can develop the \\nability to digest or rapidly evacuate the insecticide prior to suffering damage to vital \\norgans and tissues. Bodies of the target insect can also sometimes change at the \\nmolecular level to render a toxin ineffective. Body walls can become more difficult to \\npermeate, while behavioral changes like better detection and avoidance may lead to \\nresistance as well. Yields are reduced once resistant individuals in an insect \\npopulation grow in frequency. While random mutations (molecular, solar radiation, \\netc.) can make certain individuals resistant to a particular mode of action, it is not a \\npesticide using said mode of action is applied that resistant individuals dramatically \\nincrease in frequency and impact yields. In certain cases, insects may develop \\nresistance to more than one pesticide (cross resistance) if common chemistry and \\nmodes of action are employed.  \\n \\nFigure 18: Resistance, residue, and regulations create a dangerous cycle for farmers  \\n \\nSource: Company reports \\n \\nGreenLight Biosciences\\nInitiation of Coverage\\nBuy  Target Price US$4.00  | 8 December 2022\\nSustainability - Agriculture & Food Tech 19\\n \\n20 \\n \\nFigure 19: Plant Health product TAMs \\n \\nSource: Company reports \\n \\nColorado potato beetle  \\n \\nFigure 20: Colorado potato beetle summary  \\n \\nSource: Company reports, Canaccord Genuity  \\nThe total addressable market for crop protection from the Colorado potato beetle is \\nroughly $350 million. Originally described as a pest in the US in 1859, the Colorado \\npotato beetle (Leptinotarsa decemlineata) is recognized for its ability to quickly build \\nup resistance against pesticides. The company estimates that the Colorado potato \\nbeetle causes approximately $500 million in annual crop losses, representing an \\nattractive opportunity for pest management solutions. GRNA has completed more \\nthan 100 field trials over the last four years and has submitted its product candidate \\nto the EPA for approval. The candidate application is mixed in with water and \\nsprayed using typical agricultural practices over crops, at a rate of roughly 9.9 \\ngrams per hectare, equivalent to a spoonful of sugar spread on a conventional  \\nGreenLight Biosciences\\nInitiation of Coverage\\nBuy  Target Price US$4.00  | 8 December 2022\\nSustainability - Agriculture & Food Tech 20\\n \\n21 \\n \\nfootball field and less than one-tenth of that of conventional industrial chemicals \\nutilized across fields. After consuming the dsRNA, the beetle ceases to eat and \\nultimately expires as a result of its own toxins, while having no adverse effects on \\nnon-target insects. The dsRNA itself eventually degrades within days following the \\ninitial application. \\n \\nThe company’s foliar RNA product was first submitted for regulatory approval with \\nthe EPA in October 2020, and GRNA believes that the performance and price of the \\nproduct will be competitive with current products available. The company has tested \\nthis product in New York, Maine, Wisconsin, Washington, Oregon, and Idaho over \\nthe previous three annual growing seasons. In addition, field tests were conducted \\nin France, Germany, and Spain. During the tests, the product demonstrated its \\nability to manage Colorado potato beetles while remaining safe for other non-target \\nmammals and insects including butterflies and honeybees, at a use rate 100x higher \\nthan the recommended rate. GRNA expects to fully commercialize its product for the \\nColorado potato beetle in 2023, assuming that EPA approval is received in 2023.  \\nWithin three days of application, the product degrades into natural, benign \\nnucleotides due to its water solubility. In addition, the product has been formulated \\nwith other inert ingredients which enable it to be easily mixed in with other \\nagricultural products and can be applied using common methods such as low-water \\nvolume aerial or ground sprays as well as chemigation. The product also works well \\nwith standard growers’ programs to manage first- and second-generation Colorado \\nPotato Beetles, demonstrating effective control during each development stage, \\nthough most effective on young larvae up to one-quarter inch in length. Another \\nbenefit of the company’s product is that it may be applied using work gloves, as \\nopposed to the special equipment typically needed by farmers when applying \\nconventional chemical pesticides.  \\n \\nThe consideration of farmers’ needs has remained at the forefront throughout the \\ncompany’s development of its CPB product candidate, aiming to provide a solution \\nthat is supportive of biodiversity while addressing the more than $500 million \\nchallenge posed by the beetle. During field trials conducted in 2020, it was observed \\nthat 9.9 grams of the company’s RNA per hectare resulted in noticeable control of \\nCPB. The RNA product candidate was developed to meet the buying criteria of \\ngrowers, matching the efficacy and cost of existing chemical-based treatments. \\nSimilarly, GreenLight’s product candidate has been designed to be compatible with \\nfarmers’ standard operating procedures, pose little to no risk to operators and \\nconsumers, leave behind little to no residue, and leave non-target organisms like \\npollinators unharmed.  \\n \\nGRNA has gone from its initial concept for the CPB product candidate to an \\nanticipated first product registration in roughly six years, outpacing the ten years-\\nor-longer process typically observed across the industry. In 2017, the company \\nsuccessfully developed an RNA process proof of concept after which it filed the IP. \\nThis was followed by an evaluation of sequences for the first product as well as the \\nestablishing of analytical methods to be used as the process continued to be scaled. \\nThat same year, GRNA’s product candidate successfully achieved specifications for \\nactive ingredients and reached a cost target with a process that was commercially \\nviable. In 2018 the company ran its first greenhouse and field trials and developed a \\nproprietary sequence for its product candidate. The company was also able to \\noptimize the formulation and composition of the product. 2019 saw the company \\nlock down a formulation and focus on enhancing its manufacturing process, \\ndesigning its facility in Rochester and conducting 29 field trials across the US. The \\nfollowing year, in 2020, GRNA conducted regulatory studies for its CPB product and \\nsubmitted it for approval. The Rochester facility was constructed, and the company \\nconducted more than 60 field trials throughout Europe, the US, and Canada. GRNA \\nwas also awarded the foundational IP (US Pat. 10,858,385). During 2021, the \\ncompany conducted more than 40 field trials across the US and Europe and saw its \\nRochester facility achieve kilogram-scale production of dsRNA batches. Looking \\nahead to the rest of 2022, GRNA anticipates the EPA registration and commercial \\nFigure 21: Colorado potato \\nbeetle \\n \\nSource: Company Reports \\nGreenLight Biosciences\\nInitiation of Coverage\\nBuy  Target Price US$4.00  | 8 December 2022\\nSustainability - Agriculture & Food Tech 21\\n \\n22 \\n \\nlaunch of its CPB product. Subsequently, the company anticipates the beginning of \\nfield trials and a submission to the EPA for approval of its bee health product, \\ndeveloped within IP acquired from Bayer towards the end of 2020.  \\n \\n \\nVarroa mite  \\n \\nFigure 22: Varroa mite summary  \\n \\nSource: Company reports, Canaccord Genuity  \\nThe company acquired the rights to portions of a topical RNA intellectual property \\nportfolio from Bayer, which includes assets that are aimed at promoting health \\namong bees. GRNA is currently in the process of developing an easy-to-use syrup \\nderived from RNA that can eliminate reproductive mites that will be able to act as an \\nadditional tool in the limited market for controlling Varroa mites.  \\nThe company has also been conducting field tests for its RNA-based product \\ncandidate for the Varroa Destructor mite, considered to be one of the top threats to \\nhoneybees by beekeepers. Since March 2021, in collaboration with beekeepers in \\nMaine, Florida, Georgia, and California, varroa mites have been detected in as much \\nas 90% of hives in the US. The tests to-date have so far demonstrated measurable \\ndegrees of improvement across hive health which is typically measured by bee \\nmanagement personnel via visual assessments of capped and uncapped hive cells \\nthat contain larvae (referred to as closed and open broods respectively) which are \\nthen assigned scores. The assessments also use an overall scored evaluation of the \\nhive including its appearance, drone productivity, and the health of its broods and \\nqueen. Measurements of hive health also account for factors other than mite count \\nand include potential harmful effects from the pathogens mites can introduce into \\nthe hive, environmental factors, and the potential harmful effects of chemical \\npesticides which all can affect overall hive health. Tests which measured hive health \\n12 weeks following the application of the Varroa mite product indicated an \\nimprovement in open brood health by 20%, a 17% improvement in overall hive \\nhealth, and an improvement of 20% in closed brood health. These hives were \\ncompared to those which were measured 12 weeks following the application of \\ncommercial standard chemical Varroa mite control product.  \\nDuring its hive health assessments, the company has also measured the populations \\nand control of mites prior to and following the application of its product and referred \\nto the USDA’s guidelines in its Agricultural Research Services for measuring mite \\npopulations. Following these guidelines throughout the duration of the field tests, \\nthe company’s assessments indicated that after six weeks following treatment, mite \\npopulations declined by 80% and by 77% after 12 weeks since application.  \\nThere are approximately 3 million commercial honeybee colonies in the US that are \\nused in order to pollinate over 100 crops each year, estimated to be worth $15 \\nbillion, according to the US Department of Agriculture (USDA). A parasite which \\nfeeds on honeybees, Varroa mites reproduce in beehives and spread diseases which \\nimpact bee colonies worldwide.  \\n \\nGreenLight Biosciences\\nInitiation of Coverage\\nBuy  Target Price US$4.00  | 8 December 2022\\nSustainability - Agriculture & Food Tech 22\\n \\n23 \\n \\nAt the time of the portfolio acquisition, it was disclosed by Bayer that its original \\nVarroa mite product demonstrated adverse effects on ladybugs during laboratory \\ntests. At that time, GRNA had been working on its own version of the product \\nutilizing a different composition than the original Bayer product. The company notes \\nthat thus far, there have been no adverse side effects observed following the \\napplication of the company’s products. Even should there be adverse effects \\nobserved, the company is confident that it will maintain its ability to secure an EPA \\nregistration. In order to mitigate potential adverse effects on ladybugs, the company \\nnotes that the product will be delivered in a sealed package during a season in \\nwhich ladybugs do not typically enter beehives, making it unlikely that ladybugs \\nwould be affected. The company has yet to complete its field trials of the Varroa \\nmite product in order to determine whether the mites will be effectively managed. \\nDuring the ongoing EPA approval process, the company has continued to engage in \\nfield and laboratory tests, including high-dose tests as required to determine any \\nrisks associated with possible overexposure to the product. The company notes that \\nduring an in-laboratory test in which 10x the field use rate of the product was \\napplied, the treated bee food became highly viscous due to the higher concentration \\nof the product which in turn affected consumption and resulted in bee starvation. \\nThese adverse effects were not observed, however, when the company administered \\nits product at the high-dose rate in the field, nor when the product was applied at \\nconventional field-use rate in the laboratory. GRNA believes that the product does \\nnot pose a material risk to bees being exposed to concentrations higher than the \\nfield use rate due to the fact that the product is delivered through a ready-to-use \\nformulation which comes in a pre-measured pouch delivery system, not \\nconventional spraying. Without an established precedent product, the EPA \\nevaluation may require additional field trials and delay the regulatory review period.  \\nFailure to reduce the mortality rate of bees in high-dose safety factor testing may \\nresult in a denial of approval from the EPA, or the requirement to utilize labeling \\nwhich may materially limit the commercial viability of the product.  \\n \\nIn order to submit a registration dossier to the EPA in 2023, the company will need \\nto complete additional required studies, including a study assessing bee safety that \\nis available on a seasonal basis. This study is part of the normal course of an EPA \\nregistration and generally cannot be conducted during colder winter months, \\nalthough the company could potentially utilize a suitable equatorial location. The \\ncompany expects to be able to submit its product candidate for approval in the US \\nduring the first half of 2023 and launch sometime in 2024. For other geographies \\nsuch as the EU, the company will be required to apply for authorization of its Varroa \\nmite product as an animal health product under the relevant veterinary medicine \\nregulations.  \\n \\nBotrytis  \\n \\nFigure 24: Botrytis summary \\n \\nSource: Company reports, Canaccord Genuity  \\n \\nA global threat to fresh fruit and vegetables and affecting roughly 80% of crops \\ngrown and the fungus resulting in up to 30% yield loss, Botrytis cinerea which \\ncauses grey mold and bunch rot and can cause even more produce loss when it \\ndevelops in transit to the consumer. Berries, onions, and grapes are a few crops \\nFigure 23: Varroa mites \\n \\nSource: Company Reports \\nGreenLight Biosciences\\nInitiation of Coverage\\nBuy  Target Price US$4.00  | 8 December 2022\\nSustainability - Agriculture & Food Tech 23\\n \\n24 \\n \\nthat require frequent spraying which in turn leads to resistance to fungicides and \\nthe carrying of several product residues, in addition to not being able to withstand \\nrain and humidity. The company began testing a product designed to target Botrytis \\nin 2021 in New York, California, and Italy, with the projected submission for EPA \\napproval set to be sometime in 2023. Accounting for the EPA approval cycle which \\ntypically takes between 18-24 months (though California may lag the process by up \\nto a year or more), the company expects to begin commercialization of the product \\nsometime after 2025. GRNA tested strawberries and grapes in the field and the \\nproduct demonstrated successful disease control, and the company entered into \\nPhase 2, or pre-development, phase, in December 2021 when the next portfolio \\nreview will be held. The company expects to advance the product into Phase 3 \\ntowards the end of 2022 or early 2023 and, pending additional tests and regulatory \\napproval, bring the product to market after 2025.  \\n \\n \\nGrapevine powdery mildew  \\n \\nFigure 25: Powdery mildew summary  \\n \\nSource: Company reports, Canaccord Genuity  \\n \\nPowdery mildew is the most common and destructive disease that affects grapes. \\nObserved towards the upper surface of leaves as a dusty-white or grey coating, the \\ndisease also strikes the lower surface, buds, young stems, canes, fruit, and flowers. \\nLeaves which are severely infected may begin to show signs of deformity and \\nmottling, including the withering and curling of leaves. When first infected, fruit \\ntypically turns grayish white then brown, usually with a rusted appearance that \\nshrivels, cracks, and can drop in clusters. GRNA began its first season of field trials \\nin 2021 in California and New York, demonstrating successful disease control with \\nthe product candidate similar to the current leading chemical control products. The \\ncompany expects to conduct at least one more year of field trials, towards the goal \\nof ultimately submitting the candidate for regulatory approval in 2023. Assuming \\nthat the product receives EPA approval by 2025, the company anticipates \\ncommercialization that same year, though it is noted that California could lag the \\nEPA approval process by a year or more and that other, non-US grape regions \\nincluding France could take several additional years before receiving approval. GRNA \\ntested strawberries and grapes in the field and the product demonstrated successful \\ndisease control, and the company anticipates that it will enter the second, or pre-\\ndevelopment, phase, by December 2022 when the next portfolio review will be held. \\nThe company then expects to advance the product into Phase 3 of the development \\nprocess towards the end of 2022 and, pending additional tests and regulatory \\napproval, bring the product to market by 2025. \\n \\n \\n \\n \\nGreenLight Biosciences\\nInitiation of Coverage\\nBuy  Target Price US$4.00  | 8 December 2022\\nSustainability - Agriculture & Food Tech 24\\n \\n25 \\n \\nDiamondback moth  \\n \\nFigure 26: Diamondback moth summary \\n \\nSource: Company reports, Canaccord Genuity  \\n \\nAlso referred to as the cabbage moth due to its appetite for brassicas plants, the \\ndiamondback moth (Plutella xylostella) represents a global challenge to farmers and \\ngrowers due to its short life cycle, which allows it to rapidly develop resistance to \\nexisting crop protection products. GreenLight has tested diamondback moth larvae \\nin greenhouse assays, feeding them with foliage that had been treated with the \\nmoths’ specific RNA sequence in combination with the different delivery technologies \\ndeveloped at GRNA. The company believes that the moth may be controllable \\nthrough the use of a dsRNA-based pesticide and has since begun testing delivery \\nmethods which will deploy the product to the field. Should delivery mechanisms be \\ndeveloped successfully, GRNA expects that it will be able to go forward with entering \\nthe field-testing stage for the product followed by the pre-development phase in \\n2023 and development phase in 2024. Should the company remain on track, it will \\npursue a product launch after 2026. \\n \\n \\nFusarium head blight  \\n \\nFigure 27: Fusarium summary  \\n \\nSource: Company reports, Canaccord Genuity  \\n \\nFusarium head blight is a disease of cereal crops caused by Fusarium graminearum \\nand is typically found in the United States and Europe, though some other Fusarium \\nspecies are implicated. Species of Fusarium have a wide range of hosts and have \\nthe potential to cause many different types of damage to crops depending on the \\ntype of crop plant and its growth stage when initially infected. In its form in which it \\ninfects the flowering ear of cereal crops, Fusarium does not necessarily reduce \\nyields but rather produces mycotoxins as part of its metabolic process which in turn \\ncan cause serious illness and even death when consumed in small quantities, which \\nis why the detection limit in process food stuffs of 11ppm. The company believes \\nthat dsRNA can be designed in order to inhibit the metabolic pathway that produces \\nthe mycotoxins, something not yet achieved with current fungicides available on the \\nmarket. GRNA’s product candidate is currently in the Discovery 1B phase, having \\ndemonstrated under controlled conditions that it is able to stop the production of \\nmycotoxin on wheat. Based on the company’s product development to-date, it is \\nGreenLight Biosciences\\nInitiation of Coverage\\nBuy  Target Price US$4.00  | 8 December 2022\\nSustainability - Agriculture & Food Tech 25\\n \\n26 \\n \\nanticipated that the project will be able to move into Phase 3 of the development \\nprocess in late 2023. This in turn will allow GRNA to move through the remaining \\nphases of development and bring the product to market by 2026.  \\n \\n \\nTwo-spotted spider mite  \\n \\nFigure 28: Two-spotted spider mite \\n \\nSource: Company reports, Canaccord Genuity  \\n \\nTwo-spotted spider mites (Tetranychus urticae) (TSSM) are arachnids which feed on \\nplants, causing damage during each stage of the life cycle. TSSM pierce cells on to \\nthe surfaces of leaves to extract nutrients, ultimately rendering the cells useless. \\nTSSM typically feed on a wide variety of crops ranging from tree nuts to glasshouse \\nornamentals and fruits to corns and soybeans and can be found nearly wherever \\ncrops are grown. The company’s project for a TSSM-related product candidate is \\ncurrently in the discovery phase and has been recording good control from the on-\\nplant assays and requiring no further development of specific delivery technologies. \\nGRNA is anticipating progression into the pre-development stage in 2023, followed \\nrapidly with product development in 2024 by initially focusing on controlled \\nenvironment crops. \\n \\nFungicides  \\nThe company’s program for fungicides products currently has a pipeline that has \\nseven primary targets. The program includes products which will target fusarium, \\nbotrytis, powdery mildew, wheat septoria, Asian soybean rust, downy mildew, and \\nblack Sigatoka. GRNA’s fungicide programs for powdery mildew and botrytis control \\nare in the process of being field tested, and the company expects to submit them, \\nas well as its program for fusarium, for EPA approval sometime in 2023.  \\n \\nHoneybee IP obtained via acquisition  \\nThe company acquired the rights to portions of a topical RNA intellectual property \\nportfolio from Bayer, which includes assets that are aimed at promoting health \\namong bees. GRNA is currently in the process of developing an easy-to-use syrup \\nderived from RNA that can eliminate reproductive mites that will be able to act as an \\nadditional tool in the limited market for controlling Varroa mites. The company has \\nbeen working to quickly develop and advance its RNA-based solution and has so far \\nrecorded promising field results, noting that after 12 weeks following application of \\nGS15 there were approximately 40% fewer Varroa mites in hives compared to using \\na leading chemical control product in the same period. Assuming successful testing \\nand eventual regulatory approval, GRNA plans to focus its near-term commercial \\nefforts throughout the region referred to as the “smile” of the US.

Risks to our outlook include clinical and \\nregulatory, financing, commercialization, manufacturing, and intellectual property \\nrisks. Investors are encouraged to review regulatory filings for additional risk \\nfactors.  \\n\\uf0b7 \\nClinical, regulatory, and competitive risk – There is no guarantee for \\napproval of GreenLight’s candidates in development. GreenLight’s therapeutic \\nproducts may cause potentially serious adverse events and side effects which \\ncould interrupt or halt clinical trial development. GreenLight’s drug candidates \\ncould fail to show sufficient risk/benefit profiles to support regulatory approval \\nand significant penetration into markets. Additional information and/or \\nadditional trials could be required by regulators to address any safety or efficacy \\nconcerns. If this were to occur, this could significantly delay revenue generation \\ngoing forward and could materially impact our forecasts. \\n\\uf0b7 \\nFinancing risk – The company was originally incorporated in 2008 and, as \\nsuch, brings a fairly limited operational history, and is subject to the risks \\nnormally experienced by any early-stage company, including but not limited to \\nundercapitalization, cash shortages, limitations with respect to personnel, \\nfinancial and other resources, and lack of revenues.  \\n\\uf0b7 \\nCommercial and partnership risk – As a young biotechnology company, \\nGRNA has yet to establish its own sales, marketing, and distribution capabilities, \\nthe success of which will be imperative for the commercialization of products \\ndeveloped. GreenLight or its partners could be unable to generate the revenues \\nwe forecast. Even should the company succeed in delivering products to market \\non schedule, the risk of market acceptance will remain a factor for consideration \\nas the commercial success of the company’s products will require acceptance \\namong the medical and agricultural communities. Physician, patient, or payor \\nuptake could possibly be impacted by more efficacious treatment options and/or \\nones that are easier to adhere to, which would also affect our revenue \\nprojections. \\n\\uf0b7 \\nManufacturing risk – GreenLight’s product candidates have complex \\nmanufacturing processes with potential risk of interruption due to \\ncontamination, production yield variability, and product quality inconsistency, \\namong other factors. The main barrier for developing dsRNA has historically \\nbeen the costs associated with the manufacturing of RNA itself. GRNA’s \\nproprietary cell-free technology platform addresses this challenge, though other \\ncommercial, social, delivery, and technical challenges remain. It is noted that \\nnot every organism will readily ingest dsRNA in the same way as the Varroa \\nmite and Colorado potato beetle have done, which means that GRNA will have \\nto leverage innovative strategies in order to overcome certain barriers \\nassociated with lepidoptera, or the rate of breakdown in the gut, and plants, \\nspecifically the passage across membranes.

These analysts may not be associated\\npersons of Canaccord Genuity LLC and therefore may not be subject to the FINRA Rule 2241 and NYSE Rule 472 restrictions on\\ncommunications with a subject company, public appearances and trading securities held by a research analyst account.\\nSector Coverage\\nIndividuals identified as “Sector Coverage” cover a subject company’s industry in the identified jurisdiction, but are not authoring\\nanalysts of the report.\\nInvestment Recommendation\\nDate and time of first dissemination: December 08, 2022, 05:04 ET\\nDate and time of production: December 08, 2022, 05:04 ET\\nTarget Price / Valuation Methodology:\\nBioNTech SE - BNTX\\nBioNTech has multiple drug candidates in development. We derive a value of $191 per BNTX common share based on a probability-\\nadjusted sum-of-the-parts analysis. We estimate the COVID vaccine program (beyond 2022) is worth $90 per share. Development\\npipeline programs comprise $15/sh, based on a DCF model of their expected contribution. Lastly, expected cash/trade receivables\\n(net of funded debt) at YE22 ($87/sh) comprises the remainder of our valuation of BNTX shares.\\nRisks to achieving Target Price / Valuation:\\nBioNTech SE - BNTX\\nRisks to our outlook include clinical and regulatory, financing, commercialization, manufacturing, and intellectual property risks.\\nClinical, regulatory, and competitive risk – There is no guarantee for approval of BioNTech’s candidates in development.\\nBioNTech’s therapeutic products may cause potentially serious adverse events and side effects which could interrupt or halt clinical\\ntrial development. BioNTech’s drug candidates could fail to show sufficient risk/benefit profiles to support regulatory approval and\\nsignificant penetration into markets. Additional information and/or additional trials could be required by regulators to address any\\nsafety or efficacy concerns. If this were to occur, this could significantly delay revenue generation going forward and could materially\\nimpact our forecasts.\\nCommercial and partnership risk – BioNTech or its partners could be unable to generate the revenues we forecast. Physician,\\npatient, or payor uptake could possibly be impacted by more efficacious treatment options and/or ones that are easier to adhere to,\\nwhich would also affect our revenue projections.\\nManufacturing risk – Some of BioNTech’s products are genetically modified cellular products and have complex manufacturing\\nprocesses with potential risk of interruption due to contamination, production yield variability, and product quality inconsistency,\\namongst other factors. Manufacturing capacity of personalized therapeutics may be lower than anticipated due to longer-than-\\nexpected cycle times.\\nIntellectual property risk – BioNTech’s issued patents may be ignored, invalidated or expire, allowing additional competitors to\\nenter its markets.\\nDistribution of Ratings:\\nGlobal Stock Ratings (as of 12/08/22)\\nRating\\nCoverage Universe\\nIB Clients\\n#\\n%\\n%\\nBuy\\n634\\n66.32%\\n27.60%\\nHold\\n145\\n15.17%\\n17.93%\\nSell\\n14\\n1.46%\\n0.00%\\nSpeculative Buy\\n155\\n16.21%\\n40.00%\\n956*\\n100.0%\\n*Total includes stocks that are Under Review\\nGreenLight Biosciences\\nInitiation of Coverage\\nBuy  Target Price US$4.00  | 8 December 2022\\nSustainability - Agriculture & Food Tech 32\\nCanaccord Genuity Ratings System\\nBUY: The stock is expected to generate risk-adjusted returns of over 10% during the next 12 months.\\nHOLD: The stock is expected to generate risk-adjusted returns of 0-10% during the next 12 months.\\nSELL: The stock is expected to generate negative risk-adjusted returns during the next 12 months.\\nNOT RATED: Canaccord Genuity does not provide research coverage of the relevant issuer.\\n“Risk-adjusted return” refers to the expected return in relation to the amount of risk associated with the designated investment or\\nthe relevant issuer.\\nRisk Qualiﬁer\\nSPECULATIVE: Stocks bear significantly higher risk that typically cannot be valued by normal fundamental criteria.

A short-term trade idea offers a\\nnear-term view on how a security may trade, based on market and trading events or catalysts, and the resulting trading opportunity\\nthat may be available. Any such trading strategies are distinct from and do not affect the analysts' fundamental equity rating for\\nsuch stocks. A short-term trade idea may differ from the price targets and recommendations in our published research reports that\\nreflect the research analyst's views of the longer-term (i.e. one-year or greater) prospects of the subject company, as a result of the\\ndiffering time horizons, methodologies and/or other factors. It is possible, for example, that a subject company's common equity that\\nis considered a long-term ‘Hold' or 'Sell' might present a short-term buying opportunity as a result of temporary selling pressure in\\nthe market or for other reasons described in the research report; conversely, a subject company's stock rated a long-term 'Buy' or\\n“Speculative Buy’ could be considered susceptible to a downward price correction, or other factors may exist that lead the research\\nanalyst to suggest a sale over the short-term. Short-term trade ideas are not ratings, nor are they part of any ratings system, and\\nthe firm does not intend, and does not undertake any obligation, to maintain or update short-term trade ideas. Short-term trade\\nideas are not suitable for all investors and are not tailored to individual investor circumstances and objectives, and investors should\\nmake their own independent decisions regarding any securities or strategies discussed herein.

Recall, this study enrolled 31 female Rett\\npatients through a seven-week evaluation period. The data further reiterates that the\\nactivation of SIGMAR1 actively restores neural cells to homeostasis and thus promotes\\nneuroplasticity. The data from the Phase 2 US trial is noteworthy as it is the first time that\\na biomarker has correlated with clinical efficacy in Rett syndrome patients.\\nData also demonstrated that patients prespecified with WT SIGMAR1 had a 14.5-\\npoint improvement of the Rett Syndrome Behavior Questionnaire or RSBQ score\\nwhen compared to placebo with a p-value of 0.009. Recall, this was the primary\\nefficacy endpoint. Improvements were recognized across all subscales including general\\nmood, breathing, hand behavior, repetitive face movements, body rocking, night-time\\nbehavior, anxiety, walking, and standing. Further patients also demonstrated a12.9-point\\nimprovement according to the Anxiety, Depression, and Mood Scale or ADAMS with a\\np-value of 0.005.\\nBased on the compelling nature of the data, Anavex is planning to meet with the FDA to\\ndetermine the best and most efficient path to approval as there are currently no available\\noptions for Rett syndrome. ANAVEX 2-73 previously received Fast Track designation,\\nRare Pediatric Disease designation, and Orphan Drug designation from the FDA. The\\ncompany will continue to progress both the AVATAR (adult) and EXCELLENCE (pediatric)\\nRett syndrome trials with data also expected during 2021. We are highly encouraged by\\nthis announcement and recognize that potential commercialization, contingent on FDA\\napproval, could occur in the near- to medium-term.\\nWe are also taking the opportunity to provide an update on previously announced trial\\nprogress and a third-party publication. First, the company announced that enrollment\\nhad exceeded 450 patients in the ongoing ANAVEX 2-73-AD-EP-004 trial evaluating\\nthe efficacy, tolerability, and safety of two different doses of ANAVEX 2-73. This trial,\\nsimilar to the above-mentioned, is also including a prespecified biomarker SIGMAR1\\nexpression which previously demonstrated improved cognition and daily living functions\\nin the Alzheimer’s Phase 2a study. Notably, we continue to anticipate topline data for the\\ntrial during 2022.\\nTurning to recent publications, ANAVEX 2-73 was featured in a publication titled\\n“The emerging role of the sigma-1 receptor in autophagy: Hand-in-hand targets for\\nthe treatment of Alzheimer’s” in peer-reviewed journal Expert Opinion on Therapeutic\\nTargets. The article highlighted that SIGMAR1’s expression increases with age but\\ndoes not increase in Alzheimer’s disease which is concurrent with age-related decrease\\nin autophagy. Further, the publication reiterated that SIGMAR1 is activated by the\\nANAVEX compounds and also induces autophagy. We believe publications such as\\nthis demonstrate and reiterate the potential applicability of ANAVEX 2-73 in large CNS\\ndiseases including Alzheimer's and potentially others.\\nBased on the expanded commercial opportunity, we are making modifications to our\\nfinancial estimates. Based on our Comparable Company Valuation table, we believe that\\nit is appropriate to value the company based on a revenue multiple for 2025. We have\\ndetermined that the company’s valuation should be 10.5 times our FY-2025 revenue\\nestimate of $316.3 million discounted by 2.5 years at 12%, or $28.75 (previously $19.50).\\n \\n \\n \\nValuation  \\n \\nFinancial Assumption and Modelling \\n \\n \\n       Exhibit 1: Quarterly Revenue  \\n \\nSource: Ladenburg Thalmann & Co., Inc. estimates \\n \\nExhibit 2: Quarterly Gain and Loss* \\n \\nSource: Ladenburg Thalmann & Co., Inc. estimates \\n*Past performance is not indicative of future results. \\n \\n \\nJeffrey S.

Cohen 561.620.2049\\nAnavex Life Sciences Corp. (AVXL)\\nPage 4\\n \\n \\nPrimary Risks \\n \\nIn addition to normal economic and market risk factors that impact most all equities, we \\nbelieve that the primary risks to our recommendation and price target of an investment in \\nAnavex Life Sciences Corp. shares include, but are not limited to:  \\nDrug development risk: Anavex Life Sciences Corp. is a development stage company \\nconducting clinical trials for its lead product. The company faces the risks of the drug \\ndevelopment industry, including scientific, technical, clinical, regulatory failures. As novel \\ntherapies, the drugs also face risks with reimbursement and product adoption. The \\ncompany is pursuing indications where there have been many failures, including \\nAlzheimer’s disease and Parkinson’s disease, where efficacy may be difficult to prove. \\nCOVID-19 restrictions may also impact the timeframes for initiation of new clinical trials, \\npatient enrollment, and presentation of data. \\nCompany risks: The company has incurred significant losses and negative cash flow \\noperations since inception and they expect to incur losses and negative cash flows for at \\nleast the next 12 months. The company is dependent on the success of ANAVEX 2-73 \\nincluding the indications in clinical trials. Their independent registered public accounting \\nfirm has expressed doubt about their ability to continue as a going concern. As of \\nSeptember 30, 2020, the company had an accumulated deficit of $153.7 million and is not \\nexpected to generate any revenue from operations in the near future. Cash on hand is \\nsufficient to fund near-term operations, although we expect the company to raise capital \\nbefore its products generate revenue. \\nProduct development risk: Anavex must conduct clinical trials, apply for FDA approval, \\nand launch its first product. Product adoption may depend on perceived benefits and \\nmarketing efforts. As a clinical development company, it does not have a sales force. It \\nmay form a collaborative agreement with another company to market the drug or develop \\na specialty sales force. \\nInternational risks: The company’s clinical trials include sites in Australia. International \\naspects of their business expose the company to business, regulatory, political, \\noperational, financial and economic risks associated with doing business outside the US. \\nUnfavorable global economic conditions could adversely affect their business, financial \\nconditions, or results of operations. \\nIntellectual property risk: The field of patents and intellectual property involves complex \\nscientific and legal issues that are subject to change by legislation or judicial action. The \\ncompany holds its own patent portfolio and has licensed patents from other parties. Other \\ncompanies with greater resources may challenge the company through the legal system \\nor in the marketplace. \\nClinical supplies and manufacturing risk: Anavex leases its operating facilities and \\ndepends on clinical trial managers and third-party suppliers for its clinical trial grade \\nmaterials, including the active pharmaceutical ingredients. We believe the supply of \\nclinical materials is sufficient to conduct the trials, but third-party manufacturing still carries \\na risk of problems or disagreements that could cause delays. \\nJeffrey S. Cohen 561.620.2049\\nAnavex Life Sciences Corp. (AVXL)\\nPage 5\\n \\n \\nRegulatory risk: The company has conducted pre-clinical trials and received Fast Track, \\nPediatric Rare Disease, and Orphan drug designation from the FDA. These designations \\nprovide regulatory and financial benefits and were created by Congressional legislation. \\nAlthough we believe the clinical and pre-clinical data indicate efficacy, further testing is \\nneeded before market approval. The findings from clinical trials must be reviewed by the \\nFDA before the company receives approval to continue clinical testing. Analysis by the \\nFDA may not agree with the analysis presented by the company. Approval of the \\napplication cannot be assumed. \\nExchange and market risk: AVXL shares trade on the NASDAQ exchange and have \\nrelatively small daily volume. The company is expected to continue raising capital to fund \\noperations before its products reach the market, which is subject to market conditions. \\nLegislation and policy changes: Laws for drug approval are established by Congress \\nand administered by the FDA. Reimbursement by third-party payors often follows policies \\nestablished by the Center for Medicaid/Medicare Services. Both agencies are divisions of \\nthe Department of Health and Human Services, run by Commissioners appointed by the \\nPresident and confirmed by the Senate. Changes in policies or political agendas could \\nhave broad effects on the environment for drug development and reimbursement. \\n \\n \\n \\nJeffrey S.

Furthermore, no part of my compensation was, is, or will be directly or indirectly related to the specific recommendation or views\\nexpressed in this research report, provided, however, that:\\nThe research analyst primarily responsible for the preparation of this research report has or will receive compensation based upon various\\nfactors, including the volume of trading at the firm in the subject security, as well as the firm’s total revenues, a portion of which is generated\\nby investment banking activities.\\nAdditional information regarding the contents of this publication will be furnished upon request. Please contact Ladenburg Thalmann,\\nCompliance Department, 640 Fifth Avenue, 4th floor, New York, New York 10019 (or call 212-409-2000) for any information regarding current\\ndisclosures, and where applicable, relevant price charts, in regard to companies that are the subject of this research report.\\nCOMPANY BACKGROUND\\nAnavex Life Sciences Corp. is a biopharmaceutical company dedicated to the development of differentiated therapeutics for the treatment of\\nneurodegenerative and neurodevelopmental disorders including Alzheimer’s disease, Parkinson’s disease, Rett syndrome and other central\\nnervous system (CNS) diseases, pain and various types of cancer. Anavex’s lead drug candidate, ANAVEX 2-73 (blarcamesine), completed\\nsuccessfully a Phase 2a clinical trials for Alzheimer’s disease and a Phase 2 proof-of-concept study in Parkinson’s disease dementia and a\\nPhase 2 study in adult patients with Rett syndrome. ANAVEX®2-73 is an orally available drug candidate that restores cellular homeostasis\\nby targeting sigma-1 and muscarinic receptors.\\nVALUATION METHODOLOGY\\nBased on our Comparable Company Valuation table, we believe that it is appropriate to value the company based on a revenue multiple for\\n2025. We have determined that the company’s valuation should be 10.5 times our FY-2025 revenue estimate of $316.3 million discounted\\nby 2.5 years at 12%, or $28.75 (previously $19.50).\\nRISKS\\nIn addition to normal economic and market risk factors that impact most all equities, we believe that the primary risks to our recommendation\\nand price target of an investment in Anavex Life Sciences Corp. shares include, but are not limited to: drug development, company, product\\ndevelopment, international, IP, manufacturing, regulatory, exchange, and policy change risks.\\nSTOCK RATING DEFINITIONS\\nBuy: The stock’s return is expected to exceed 12.5% over the next twelve months.\\nNeutral: The stock’s return is expected to be plus or minus 12.5% over the next twelve months.\\nSell: The stock’s return is expected to be negative 12.5% or more over the next twelve months.\\nInvestment Ratings are determined by the ranges described above at the time of initiation of coverage, a change in risk, or a change in target\\nprice. At other times, the expected returns may fall outside of these ranges because of price movement and/or volatility. Such interim deviations\\nfrom specified ranges will be permitted but will become subject to review.\\nRATINGS DISPERSION AND BANKING RELATIONSHIPS AS OF (June 22, 2021)\\nRating\\n%\\nIB %\\nBUY\\n79.7\\n62.1\\nNEUTRAL\\n20.3\\n40.5\\nSELL\\n0.0\\n0.0\\nCOMPANIES UNDER JEFFREY'S COVERAGE\\nCARMAT SA (ALCAR)\\nApplied UV, Inc.

BiomX discovers and validates\\nproprietary bacterial targets and customizes phage\\ncompositions against these targets using its in-\\nhouse BOLT platform.\\n \\nWe are initiating coverage of BiomX Inc. (PHGE) with a Buy rating and $25 price target.\\nBiomX is a biotechnology company that is internally developing clinical-stage phages as a\\nnovel approach in six different medical conditions. BiomX is an Israeli-based, six-year-old\\ncompany that went public in November 2017 via a merger with a SPAC. In our view, there\\nis an increased investor interest for clinical-stage assets we call, “The Naturals”, including\\nphage therapies, widely regarded as “…the most abundant organism on earth” (1031\\nparticles).\\nBiomX is developing natural and synthetic phage cocktail therapies for the treatment\\nof chronic, major medical disorders including acne, inflammatory bowel disease (IBD),\\nprimary sclerosis cholangitis (PSC), cystic fibrosis (CF), atopic dermatitis (AD) and\\ncolorectal cancer (CRC). BX001 for the treatment of acne and BX003 for PSC and IBD\\nwere developed with technology from MIT and the Weizmann Institute, while the newer\\nassets BX004 in CF and BX005 in AD were developed in-house.\\nWe are entering an event-rich 18-month stretch. BiomX is set to produce its first set\\nof four proof-of-concept data readouts this year and is expected to provide a clinical\\nupdate on every program within the next 15-18 months. In 3Q’21, we are looking for\\nBX001’s Phase 2 results in acne (8 weeks’ data) and full 12-week results in 4Q’21; the\\nIND-enabling animal data in CRC is expected in 2H’21; in 2H’21 we expect Phase 2\\nresults in CF; and in 1H’22 Phase 2 results in AD and IBD/PSC. With $64M in cash as of\\nSeptember 30 we believe BiomX sees itself through these data readouts.\\nRecommend buying ahead of Phase 2 acne data in 2H’21. We are recommending\\ninvestors accumulate a position in PHGE ahead of BX001’s 8-week Phase 2 acne data\\nin 3Q’21, which in our view has an up/down potential of 80%/20%, with today\\'s ~$6.50\\nstock reaching $10 or $5 on positive or negative Phase 2 readout. Following 12-week\\ndata in 4Q’21 we look for BiomX to strike an OTC marketing agreement.\\nTreating infections with phage. Increased rates of multi-drug resistance have\\ngenerated increased needs for novel anti-bacterial approaches against Cutibacterium\\nacnes in acne and Staphylococcus aureus in AD. Phages are able to bypass a bacteria’s\\nresistance mechanisms to invade and lyse the cell, eradicating the infection and\\ngenerating bactericidal activity in mono- and combination therapy. Phages re-sensitize\\nbacteria to antibiotics, which allows an antibiotic’s originally designed mechanism of\\naction to proceed as if the pathogen were not multi-drug resistant (MDR). Bacteria-\\nspecific, detoxified phages are exceptionally well-tolerated, shelf-stable and can be\\ndelivered via IV, subQ, inhaled, as liquid drops, a topical or a pill. The use of phages to\\ntreat infections began over a hundred years ago, but were overtaken by mass production\\nof penicillin, amoxicillin, etc. which has led to an overuse and generation of MDR bacteria.\\nAt its current pace, MDR infections are to overtake cancer in mortality rates by 2050\\n(WHO’s IACG Report, 2019).\\nEarly start with acne partnership. BiomX has partnered with a global cosmetics partner\\nfor use of BX001 as an OTC acne treatment. This undisclosed partner has the right of\\nfirst refusal to acquire BX001’s global marketing rights, which BiomX suggests is likely to\\nfollow a positive Phase 2 readout. Acne products today contain harsh active ingredients\\nsuch as salicylic acid, retinoids, or topical antibiotics, which may cause burning and\\nflaking on a patient, side effects not seen with BX001 in BiomX’s successful Phase 1 trial.\\nCOMPANY SUMMARY \\nBiomX is an Israeli-based biotechnology company focused specifically on the use of \\nbacteriophage (a.k.a. “phage”) for treating acute and chronic illnesses. Development \\nefforts stem from its phage platform, BOLT, to screen and combine natural and synthetic \\nphage particles into therapeutics. Formed as a private company in March 2015, BiomX \\nincorporated as a blank check company in November 2017 for the purposes of eventually \\ncombining businesses. The blank check company completed an IPO as Chardan \\nHealthcare Acquisition Corp. (CHAC) in December 2018, pricing 7M units at $10.00, \\ngenerating net proceeds of $69.5M.  \\n\\uf0b7 \\nThe units each consisted of one share of common stock and one warrant to \\npurchase one-half of one share of common stock, with every two Public Warrants \\nentitling the holder to purchase one share of Common Stock for $11.50 per full \\nshare.  \\n\\uf0b7 \\nAt the same time, CHAC completed a private placement of 2.9M warrants, each \\nexercisable to purchase one share of common stock for $11.50 per share, to \\nMountain Wood, LLC, generating total proceeds of $1.16M.  \\nBiomX ultimately listed on the NYSE through a reverse merger with CHAC, inheriting \\n$60.1 million in the process, and issued 16,625,000 shares of common stock, vested \\noptions or warrants to purchase common stock to vested security holders; PHGE has \\nbeen dual listed on the Tel Aviv Stock Exchange since February 2020. BiomX’s \\nmanagement maintained their leadership positions and continue to run the newly listed \\ncompany. \\nThe cash infusion gave BiomX the operational runway to begin pursuing clinical \\ndevelopment of its lead asset, BX001 for the treatment of acne, and simultaneously \\npushing forward its pipeline assets: BX003 in primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC) and \\ninflammatory bowel disease (IBD); BX004 in cystic fibrosis (CF); BX005 in atopic \\ndermatitis (AD); and an as-yet-unnamed asset in colorectal cancer (CRC). BiomX has built \\na 550 square foot in-house manufacturing facility for the development of phage products \\nintended to be developed for clinical use. The company plans to partner BX001 with a \\nleading cosmetic company and the CRC asset with an immune-oncology company, with \\nthe remaining assets to be taken independently through clinical development. \\nExhibit 1: BiomX Pipeline \\n \\n \\n \\n1BX001 is intended to be developed and commercialized as a cosmetic; 2In November 2020, BiomX announced the consolidation of \\nits IBD and PSC programs to develop one broad host range product candidate for both IBD and PSC, designated BX003 (replacing \\na previous phage product candidate for IBD named BX002); Source: BiomX March 2021 corporate presentation \\n \\n \\nMichael Higgins 212.409.2074\\nBiomX Inc. (PHGE)\\nPage 2\\nEXECUTIVE SUMMARY \\n \\nBX001 for the treatment of acne \\nCutibacterium acnes is the primary bacterial cause of acne and its treatment has been  \\nmade more difficult by increasing rates of antibiotic resistance. As far back as 1998 (just \\nfollowing the sharp rise in new antibiotics in the 1990s), 62% of clinical C. acnes (f.k.a P. \\nacnes) isolates were already resistant to at least one major treatment (e.g., clindamycin, \\ntetracycline, or erythromycin). Dermatologists lean heavily on antibiotics and represent \\nalmost half of antibiotic prescriptions, so it should come as no surprise that resistance to \\nthese agents is >90% today.  \\nGlobally, the dermatological market is currently the 9th largest major pharmaceutical \\ncategory, bringing in ~$17.3 billion in 2020 sales with an expected compounded annual \\ngrowth rate (CAGR) of 17.0% to reach $45.4B in 2026 (per EvaluatePharma [EP]; see \\nExhibit 25). This almost tripling in size in six years is astounding, as the derm category is \\nexpected to increase from the 9th to the 5th biggest category in just six years. Globally, \\nthere are ~665 million people with acne each year, or ~9.5% of the global population (Sci \\nRep (2020) 10:5754). By 2024, over 20% of the global dermatology market is estimated to \\nbe composed of acne products, for a total market of ~$7 billion. In the U.S., acne is the \\nmost common skin condition as it annually affects >50 million people, or 12-15% of the \\npopulation. Of these, ~10% seek the care of a physician. \\nThere are >300 acne products that generate ~$20 billion in global and ~$4 billion in U.S. \\nrevenues. Yet, acne remains one of the most stubborn dermatological conditions to \\nadequately treat as consumers/patients and their parents continue to buy products that \\nprovide minimal benefit versus simply washing the face with soap and water twice a day \\nand refraining from sugary foods and dairy products. Unlike most other medical conditions, \\nthe acne market is served by an overlapping blend of prescription and OTC products \\n(often same APIs in both) with patients using both OTC and Rx products, with and without \\nthe reliance of a physician, which also varies but typically includes primary care, OBGYN \\nand dermatologists. Not unlike other medical conditions, adoption is primarily driven by \\nprice, but escalates quickly if the first acne treatment fails.  \\nIn our view, BiomX has generated impressive preclinical evidence of activity, including \\nsafety, targeted efficacy, and biofilm activity. Its preclinical studies were presented March \\n2020 \\nat \\nthe \\nAmerican \\nAcademy \\nof \\nDermatology \\nmeeting \\n(https://www.biomx.com/publications/). BX001 is specific to C. acnes strains (96% \\ncoverage) without any impact on commensal strains or problematic in development of \\ndrug resistance; is able to destroy antibiotic-resistant strains alone and through biofilm \\n(>80% clearance vs. 30% for clindamycin); and does not cause significant irritation in an \\nex vivo EpiDerm or EpiOcular skin models. BiomX has so far shown BX001 is stable for \\nup to nine months at room temperature and longer under refrigeration. The gel is “ready to \\nuse”, with no mixing involved for the patient.  \\nIn March 2020, BiomX announced completion and positive results from its four-week, \\nrandomized, double-blind, three-arm, 75-patient (two-arm) Phase 1 trial. Both doses of \\nBX001 met the primary endpoint of safety and tolerability by demonstrating a similar \\nnumber of subjects with all-causality or treatment-related adverse events between all \\ngroups. In this 75-patient trial there were only four treatment-related adverse events, and \\nnone more than once per patient: exfoliation; dryness; erythema; and pruritus. There were \\nno dropouts or serious AEs. In BX001’s high dose arm, C. acnes levels were reduced by \\n24% compared to baseline but increased by 26% in the placebo arm (p=0.036). This was \\nregardless of baseline C. acnes levels. In this overall study group BX001’s low dose arm’s \\nresults were similar to placebo. Enrollment was stratified by baseline sebum levels \\nMichael Higgins 212.409.2074\\nBiomX Inc. (PHGE)\\nPage 3\\n(<>133ug/cm2), and patients randomized (1:1:1) to the high dose BX001 arm with high \\nbaseline sebum levels showed a 0.4 log difference in sebum levels vs. those with high \\nbaseline sebum levels but treated with placebo.  \\nTo better differentiate its product in the OTC acne market, BiomX is taking a less common \\nand more aggressive move for an OTC product by testing BX001 in a large Phase 2. The \\nrationale is to provide significant clinical efficacy data that could be leveraged by its \\nundisclosed global cosmetics partner. We note that BX001 could not claim acne fighting \\nabilities on its OTC label because it is being marketed as a cosmetic but can say that it \\nimproves the appearance of acne prone skin and share the Phase 2 details on the \\nproducts’ website. The Phase 2, which began dosing March 2021, is a randomized, \\nplacebo-controlled, double-blind, two-arm (n=70/arm), 12-week trial with a one-week \\nfollow-up. Importantly, the 12-week trial period should allow BiomX to assess IGA and \\nlesion numbers more effectively. In our view, this is a sophisticated trial design for an OTC \\nproduct but in line with Phase 2’s of competitive acne products. The Phase 2 has been \\naffected by Covid, which delayed its expected 2H’20 start as well as the trial size, from \\n100 to 140, per the recommendation of the undisclosed CRO that felt a higher than \\nanticipated drop-out rate could develop if patients are not able to continue returning to the \\nclinic on time.  \\nBiomX has stated it intends to partner BX001, which we expect will almost exclusively \\nbenefit BiomX via royalty revenues. While patent expiration is currently expected in 2038, \\nwe are not looking for a patent cliff from this OTC product any more than other acne \\ntreatments, especially since BiomX’s phage cocktail largely rests on unpatented \\nmanufacturing trade secrets. Most important in OTC products is the brand name \\nrecognition and reputation, so we look for BX001 to be a Top 10 selling product for \\ngenerations to come. We anticipate BiomX’s cosmetics partner will market BX001 as an \\nacne product with higher scientific rigor than others and on its product website will lean on \\nthe clinical data and all-natural phage platform with unique and safe abilities to address \\nspecific patient needs. The education of dermatologists is also likely to be expected, as \\nphysicians understand both the science and the patient need. Among others, L’Oréal \\n(OR.PA; ϵ339.15; Not Rated) and Estee Lauder (EL; $304.39; Not Rated) for example \\nhave tens of thousands of dermatology reps plus connections with dermatologists as \\nconsultants and brand ambassadors for its higher-end skincare products.  \\n \\nIt is also important to highlight the global nature of the cosmetics and OTC markets and \\nwhy it is so important BiomX has chosen to partner BX001 with a global cosmetics \\ncompany. Again, using L’Oréal as a proxy, the company highlighted in its 2019 Annual \\nReport that Asia Pacific accounted for 41% of its business and that 40% of its revenue \\ncame from the Skincare business segment. With only 21% of its revenues coming from \\nNorth America, L’Oréal therefore generated 79% of its Skincare revenue ex-U.S. \\naccounting for almost a third of total annual company revenue, highlighting the importance \\nof diverse markets in skin health. Additionally, larger companies have assorted products \\non offer, therefore  BiomX’s partner is also incentivized by an additional revenue stream \\nfrom BX001 that would complement, not cannibalize, its current cosmetic offerings. \\nIt should take ~four years to develop an OTC acne product. For BiomX, it started in 1H’19 \\nby completing its manufacturing process for BX001, started a Phase 1 in late 2019, and \\ndue to Covid delays in 2020 is on target to complete the Phase 2 in 2H’21, secure its \\nmarketing agreement with its undisclosed global cosmetic partner by early 2022, scale up \\nto commercial scale manufacturing procedures in 2022 and launch in 2023, or five years \\nfrom concept to revenues. Meanwhile, the Rx route includes IND prep and approval, plus \\npivotal trial execution, plus regulatory prep and approval, which regularly take over seven \\nyears and likely longer with Covid delays. \\nMichael Higgins 212.409.2074\\nBiomX Inc. (PHGE)\\nPage 4\\nBX003 for the treatment of IBD and PSC \\nBiomX is developing BX003 against specific clades of Klebsiella pneumoniae, a gram-\\nnegative, encapsulated, non-motile bacterium of the Enterobacteriaceae family (Acta \\nPaediatr (2019) 108(1):76-82). Originally discovered in 1882 in the lungs of patients who \\nhad died of pneumonia, Klebsiella is now known to be mainly concentrated in the \\ngastrointestinal tract of up to 38% of individuals in the general community and up to 77% \\nof individuals in hospital settings. This latter point is a major reason K. pneumoniae have \\ndeveloped resistance mechanisms against classic antibiotics such as extended-spectrum \\nbeta \\nlactams; \\nfor \\nexample, \\nas \\nof \\n2013 \\n80% \\nof \\nall \\ncarbapenem-resistant \\nEnterobacteriaceae infections were a result of K. pneumoniae (Front Microbiol (2018) \\n9:1463; Euro Surveill (2018) 23(32)). \\nThe World Health Organization has now recognized K. pneumoniae as a common culprit \\nin GI disease (Science (2017) 358(6361):359-365; J Dig Dis (2018) 19(5):262-271), which \\nhas led BiomX to develop BX003 to help treat inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and \\nprimary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC). IBD is a collection of GI disorders such as Crohn’s \\n(CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC) that can cause diarrhea, bloating and constipation; if left \\nuntreated, complications can include malnutrition and cancer. PSC causes inflammation \\nand scarring of the bile ducts, which impedes the flow of bile from the gall bladder to the \\nliver. IBD can cause extensive extraintestinal manifestations in the liver and gall bladder, \\nof which PSC is the most correlated, particularly in patients with UC (Gastroenterology \\nRes (2018) 11(2): 83–94). \\nBiomX recently (February 2021) announced positive results from its Phase 1a PK study in \\nIBD/PSC, testing the delivery of oral BX003 therapy. The Phase 1a was a 3-day MAD \\nstudy looking at safety and tolerability in healthy volunteers, with an additional analysis of \\nviable phage in stool. By finding active phage in stool the company believes this serves as \\na proxy that phage is reaching the intestines and therefore the Klebsiella infection. The \\nstudy demonstrated safety and tolerability with successful delivery of a high concentration \\nof viable phage to the lower gastrointestinal tract. Importantly, viable phage delivered was \\n~1,000 times higher than the bacterial burden of K. pneumoniae in IBD patients. We note \\nthis is the first clinical study detailing the pharmacokinetics of oral phage therapy under a \\nU.S. FDA IND protocol, highlighting the innovative nature of BiomX and its platform. \\nFollowing this study BX003 was optimized to include phage from BX002, its predecessor \\nphage cocktail, to broaden the target bacterial range. This new broader cocktail is being \\ntaken into the Phase 1b/2a and provides opportunities for BiomX to use BX003 in other \\nKlebsiella infections. \\nBiomX intends to start a Phase 1b/2a with data expected in 2Q’22. This four-week, \\nplacebo-controlled trial in 60 patients is measuring safety and efficacy as primary \\nendpoints, with important secondary endpoints such as reduction of K. pneumoniae. The \\ncompany is running a Phase 1b/2a rather than a Phase 2 and will enroll both healthy and \\ndiseased patients. Approximately 30-35% of people carry K. pneumoniae, so the bacterial \\nreduction endpoint can still be determined regardless of patient population. We anticipate \\nthis decision is to speed enrollment since the company does not need to enroll IBD/PSC \\nto prove proof-of-mechanism, especially during COVID. \\nIBD is a very large market, with the CDC citing that 1.3% of the adult population (~3 \\nmillion people) have reported they have been diagnosed with IBD; extrapolating this to all \\nages brings the total patients to ~4.3 million people. We estimate BiomX targets patients \\nthat are at higher risk of progression to PSC, which is ~57% of the total IBD population \\n(~2.5 million people), and the approximately 38% of patients harboring potentially injurious \\nKlebsiella infections, bringing the current total number of IBD patients eligible for BX003 at \\n~930,000 in the U.S. alone. PSC is significantly less prevalent than IBD despite the \\nmultitude of possible complications leading to its formation. The CDC and NEJM estimate \\nMichael Higgins 212.409.2074\\nBiomX Inc. (PHGE)\\nPage 5\\nthe prevalence of PSC at approximately 16 in 100,000 in the U.S. population (0.02%; \\n~54,000 people), and we anticipate BiomX targets patients with PSC secondary to UC/IBD \\n(80% of the PSC population, ~43,000 people) and those with confirmed Klebsiella \\ninfections (38% of the combined population). This gives us a prevalence of ~16,500 \\npeople that are eligible to receive BX003. We anticipate BiomX launches BX003 in 2025. \\n \\nBOLT platform: BX004 and BX005 for the treatment of CF and AD \\nBiomX has developed additional programs in cystic fibrosis (CF; BX004) and atopic \\ndermatitis (AD; BX005), newer programs developed through the company’s proprietary \\nBOLT (BacteriOphage Lead to Therapy) platform for screening and optimizing phage \\ncocktails. With the experience BiomX has gathered in developing phage cocktails, \\ncombined with its in-house manufacturing capabilities, the company can now develop fully \\nfunctional phage cocktails in under two years. Part of the validation allows for \\npersonalized proof-of-concept trials in humans to be run simultaneously, providing notable \\nearly safety data to allow expansion to Phase 2 trials within two years, compared to the \\n~six average for standard small molecule and biologic therapies. In these trials, each \\npatient will receive a personalized cocktail. This does not significantly increase trial time \\nbut does provide extremely personalized care, which should lead to significant \\nimprovements in patient outcomes. We look for the first proof-of-concept in CF in 4Q’21 \\nand updates from the AD trial in 1H’22. \\nThe expansion to CF is derived from the presence of Pseudomonas aeruginosa in the \\nlungs of patients. P. aeruginosa colonization is the most important contributor to morbidity \\nand mortality in CF, a disease where 80% of patients succumb to respiratory failure due to \\ninflammation and chronic bacterial infection (BMC Pulm Med (2016) 16:174). Infections in \\nCF are often treated by a standard suite of antibiotics that ultimately result in bacterial \\nresistance. CF is a common disease in the world (1:100,000 incidence), with significantly \\nmore Caucasian patients affected (1:2,500-4000) (Arch Dis Child (2014) 99(11):1033-6). \\nBiomX is currently running a Phase 2 trial in 20 CF patients with chronic P. aeruginosa \\ninfections. Each patient receives 10 days of nebulized treatment of a specialized cocktail \\noptimized based on bacterial loads from patient sputum samples. Primary endpoints are \\nsafety and efficacy, with secondary endpoints including CF-specific metrics such as FEV1 \\nand CFQ-R. BiomX anticipates topline data in 4Q’21. \\nThe Cystic Fibrosis Foundation estimates greater than 30,000 patients in the U.S., most of \\nwhom are able to be diagnosed by age two due to the genetic nature of the disease. New \\ntherapies such as Trikafta are significantly increasing patient lifespan but are not notably \\nreducing the hallmark lung infections of CF (Ann Am Thorac Soc (2020) 17(2):212–220). \\nP. aeruginosa specifically is the most common infection in CF and can drive the severity of \\ndisease throughout a patient’s life (Pediatr Clin North Am (2016) 63(4):567-584). \\nBiomX aims to treat AD through control of Staphylococcus aureus. Though not a \\ncausative agent of AD, S. aureus is present early in the disease course and drives a \\nproblematic inflammatory immune response through release of its own virulence factors \\nsuch as Protein A, the α-toxin, and the toxic-shock syndrome toxin-1 (TSST1) (Postepy \\nDermatol Alergol (2019) 36(1):11–17). Between 30-100% of patients with AD have S. \\naureus infections with the prevalence increasing with disease severity (Trends Microbiol \\n(2018) 26(6):484-497). There is significant evidence that the severity of disease and size \\nof AD lesions is directly proportional to the amount of S. aureus colonization, and that \\ncontrolling this infection helps decrease disease severity and underlying immune-driven \\ninflammation (Nat Rev Dis Primers (2018) 4(1)). \\nMichael Higgins 212.409.2074\\nBiomX Inc. (PHGE)\\nPage 6\\nIn preclinical studies, BX005 was shown to eradicate over 90% of strains from a panel of \\n120 S. aureus strains isolated from skin of subjects from the U.S. and E.U. This data led \\nBiomX directly to a Phase 2 trial, which is very similar to the CF trial. BiomX intends to \\nrecruit 80 patients to be treated for 8 weeks with a topical phage cocktail tested against a \\npatient’s skin swab, with a one-week observation period. The primary endpoints are safety \\nand efficacy, with AD-specific secondary endpoints such as EASI, IGA, and pruritis. The \\ncompany expects data in 1H’22. \\nIncidence of AD, also referred to as atopic eczema, has increased 2- to 3-fold in \\nindustrialized nations since the 1970s, with approximately 10.7% of children and 7.2% of \\nadults affected in the United States; 90% of patients develop symptoms within the first five \\nyears of life. AD is non-life threatening but significantly impacts quality of life, with >75% of \\npatients visiting a doctor in the last year specifically for AD and >10% missing multiple \\ndays of work or school, at an estimated ~$5.4 billion total burden on the U.S. health \\nsystem independent of actual treatment costs (J Am Acad Dermatol (2006) 55(3):490-500; \\nJ Invest Dermatol (2015) 135(1):56-66; Am J Manag Care (2017) 23:-S0). \\n \\nTreatment of tumors with phages \\nRecent evidence indicates solid tumors contain bacterial species, and that these bacteria \\nmay interfere with the efficacy of specific chemotherapeutic agents. In one study, 76% of \\npancreatic ductal adenocarcinomas (PDACs) were positive for bacteria, specifically \\nGammaproteobacteria (Science (2017) 357(6356):1156–1160). In a screen of Chinese \\npatients with colorectal cancer (CRC), researchers found Fusobacterium nucleatum was \\nover-represented in 87% of samples compared to normal controls (p<0.001), and that \\nover-representation of F. nucleatum was significantly (p<0.005) associated with distant \\nlymph node metastases (World J Gastroenterol (2016) 22(11):3227-33). BiomX was able \\nto corroborate these results and has begun a program to produce a phage cocktail for \\ntreatment of F. nucleatum in CRC. \\nA large number of CRC patients progress on standard of care, partly because of the “cold” \\nnature of many late-stage CRC tumors, meaning the level of T-cell infiltration is insufficient \\nto induce an immune response against the tumor (Front Immunol (2019) 10:168). The \\npossibility of turning “cold” tumors “hot” is not necessarily a new concept, but with few \\nadvances in the field and numerous failures due to the lack of appropriate tumor antigens, \\nleading to a lack of T-cell activation and immune cell homing to the tumors (Front Immunol \\n(2019) 10:168). By using phage to lyse bacteria found in >80% of patient samples, BiomX \\nhypothesizes that localized immune stimulation from bacterial PAMPs could turn the tumor \\n“hot”, providing a platform for combinatorial use with multiple types of immunotherapy. \\nIn our view, the most important data presented by BiomX for this program involves the \\nconversion of the F. nucleatum phage from lysogenic to a lytic form with an added genetic \\npayload. The company converted a lysogenic phage specific to F. nucleatum to a lytic \\nphage that carries immune-stimulating payloads including IL-15 and GM-CSF. Because F. \\nnucleatum is specific to CRC, phage are drawn to the tumor and inject their genetic \\nmaterial for replication, including the code for the immune-stimulating protein. Upon lysis \\nof the bacteria, new phage is released plus the immune-stimulating agent. Immune cells \\nare thus drawn to the tumor, turning it from “cold” to “hot”, so the immune system \\nrecognizes the tumor as foreign and checkpoint inhibitors can subsequently eradicate the \\ntumor. \\nCRC is currently poorly treated with checkpoint inhibitors outside of specific mutations, \\nsuch as MSI-high and EGFR+ (Oncologist (2020) 25(1):33-45), especially in later lines of \\ntherapy. CRC is the third most common cancer in the world, with 1.9 million new cases in \\n2020 and 935,000 deaths, according to the WHO, which makes it an extremely large \\nMichael Higgins 212.409.2074\\nBiomX Inc. (PHGE)\\nPage 7\\npotential market and therefore a rationalization for large pharma investment. We believe \\nBiomX pursues a licensing deal with a larger pharma partner to combine an immune \\ncheckpoint inhibitor with the as-yet-unnamed CRC phage asset in order to optimize the \\npotential commercial reach of this therapy. BiomX is currently undertaking pre-IND proof-\\nof-concept studies on the phage approach to treating CRC. Because of the synthetic \\nbiology approach to deploying these phages, the timelines for clinical development are \\nnotably increased compared to the other targeted illnesses in the BiomX pipeline.

BACTERIOPHAGE – NATURE’S BACTERIA KILLER \\nBacteriophages are recognized as the most ubiquitous biological agent on earth. \\nBacteriophages (a.k.a. “phages”) are viruses that are considered “nature’s killers” of \\nenvironmental bacteria. It is widely estimated there are 1031 specific living phages \\nworldwide today, with ~109 particles in each gram of soil, which turn over every few days \\n(Appl Environ Microbiol 69:6628–6633). So far, >15,000 different phages have been \\nidentified to date.  \\nPhages are composed of a head and a tail, with the tail sprouting six relatively long tail \\nfibers (see Exhibit 8). These fibers are responsible for initial binding to cell surface \\nreceptors of the phage’s specifically targeted bacterium. Upon host recognition, the tail \\nfibers unfold from the baseplate and irreversibly bind to the bacterial surface. This triggers \\nthe contraction of the tail sheath, driving the tail tube through the bacterial outer \\nmembrane and cell wall, at which point the phage’s genome is ejected from the head and \\ninto the bacterial cytoplasm. At this point the phage replicates itself via the bacteria \\nultimately lysing the bacterial membrane to produce new phage particles. This phages \\nturnover in a matter of days (Future Microbiol (2014) 9(12):1319-27; PNAS (2016) \\n113(10):2654-9).  \\nThe most studied, prototypical phage is the T4 phage (E. coli virus). Phage genomes can \\nbe as little as four genes, in the case of MS2, or as large as 300 genes in the case of T4. \\nBoth MS2 and T4 infect Escherichia coli, indicating the broad diversity of phages able to \\ninfect each bacterial strain. While natural phages are specific to single protein markers \\nfound on a bacterial host strain, engineered synthetic phages may be able to infect \\nmultiple targets. BiomX employs multiple phage development strategies for optimal \\nbacterial targeting. \\nExhibit 8: Bacteriophage particle (left) and genome (right) \\n \\nSources: PNAS (2016) 113(10):2654-9 and 2012 Virus Taxonomy ISBN 9780123846846 \\n \\nThe antibacterial properties of phages were first discovered in 1917 by Felix d\\'Herelle at \\nthe Pasteur Institute in Paris, France. His discoveries were heralded as a potential \\npanacea in the pre-antibiotic era. But following the therapeutic discovery of penicillin by \\nAlexander Fleming in 1928 and the awarding of the 1938 Nobel Prize in Medicine to \\nGerhard Domagk for work on the anti-infectives prontosil and sulfanilamide, phages’ \\nspecificity limited its appeal as an antibacterial therapy. Phage research continued in \\nmolecular biology labs, helping scientists make crucial progress in identifying the basis for \\ngenetic material (Bacteriophage (2011) 1(1): 31–45).  \\nMichael Higgins 212.409.2074\\nBiomX Inc.

(PHGE)\\nPage 12\\nThough research and use of phages in the treatment of disease has been ongoing in \\ncountries such as Georgia, only recently has attention and investment returned, driven by \\nthe continued increase in multi-drug resistance and primarily the overuse of the broad-\\nspectrum antibiotics that reduced phages’ utility 70 years ago.  \\n \\nHow do phages kill bacteria? \\nThere are two types of phages, based on their life cycle: lytic (or virulent), considered the \\nmost useful as an antibacterial therapeutic; and lysogenic (or temperate). During the lytic \\ncycle (we explain the lysogenic cycle after Exhibit 10) the bacterium’s genetic replication \\nmachinery is hijacked to prioritize expansion of the phage’s DNA- or RNA-based genome. \\nNew phage particles assemble inside the bacterium and are released by rupturing (lysing) \\nthe bacterial cell in just minutes to hours after injection of the phage’s genetic material \\n(Exhibit 10; Cell Host Microbe (2019) 25(2):219-232).  \\nIn most cases, lysis is performed by two phage-encoded proteins: holins, which form \\npores in the bacterial cell membrane; and endolysins, which degrade the cell wall by \\nhydrolyzing its peptidoglycans (Curr Microbiol (2017) 74(2):277-283). However, there’s a \\nthird type of phage protein (spanin), which degrades Gram negatives bacteria’s outermost \\nprotective layer (J Bacteriol (2015) 197(1):7-17). BiomX’s BX-003 works via this third \\nprotein (spanin) to target Klebsiella spp. \\nExhibit 10: Life cycle of a lytic bacteriophage \\n \\nSource: Lumen Learning: Microbiology (PressBooks, ©2020) \\n \\nUnlike lytic phages, lysogenic phages integrate their genetic material into the bacterial \\ngenome and propagate when the bacterium multiplies. Lysogenic phages are more useful \\nfor non-bacterial-focused applications, where insertion of a gene product into a \\npropagating bacterial strain allows significant expansion of that gene product and the \\ndownstream protein, such as insulin (Microb Cell Fact (2014) 13:141). Lysogenic phages \\nare more common outside of antibacterial purposes, such as BX003, which works with \\nBX003 in PSC and IBD. For bacteria-focused applications, lytic phages are preferred \\nsince the goal of phage infection is to destroy the bacterial host.  \\nMichael Higgins 212.409.2074\\nBiomX Inc. (PHGE)\\nPage 13\\nExhibit 11: Recurring lytic and lysogenic cycles \\n \\nSource: Viruses (2017) 9(3):50 \\n \\nIt should be noted that under cellular stress, lysogenic phages may switch to a lytic cycle \\n(Exhibit 11; Cell Host Microbe (2019) 25(2):219-232), and naturally lysogenic phages can \\nbe reprogrammed in vitro to become lytic. This reprogramming has the added advantage \\nof broadening the range of therapeutic targets, as not all lytic phages target the same \\nbacteria as lysogenic phages, and vice versa. BiomX has in-house capabilities to \\ntransform lysogenic phages to lytic phages, broadening the number of potential \\ntherapeutic targets while simultaneously developing a therapeutic more specific to a given \\nchronic disease. \\n \\nDevelopment and treatment characteristics unique to bacteriophages \\nAs mentioned earlier, phages have a distinct history as therapeutic agents, given the \\ncentury-old discovery, which technology evolved beyond, only to return as its replacement \\n(broad-spectrum antibiotics) have been overused and generated a critically needed \\nstrategy to treat multi-drug resistant (MDR) pathogens.  \\nWe identify five characteristics that are in our view unique to the development of \\ntherapeutic \\nphages, \\nincluding: \\nregulatory; \\nmanufacturing; \\npatentability; \\nbacterial \\nresistance; and pharmacokinetic (PK) parameters. Here, we describe these characteristics.  \\n1. \\nRegulators see phage cocktails like seasonal flu vaccines. Over the last few \\nyears, as academic research has led to corporate development around phage \\ntherapies, regulatory bodies have begun seriously contemplating how best to get \\nthese therapies to patients. In 2015, the EMA held a phage-oriented workshop to \\ndiscuss how current regulatory requirements might apply to phage therapies. Topics \\nincluded: shortening the approval process to fit the need of continuously adapting \\nphage cocktail combinations; whether the cocktail or each individual phage are \\nconsidered a medicinal product; and whether approval of production processes rather \\nthan specific phage products could be used to simplify and accelerate phage therapy \\napprovals (Viruses (2019) 11(3):295). In fact, together with the FDA, the EMA also \\nhelped develop the Transatlantic Taskforce on Antimicrobial Resistance (TATFAR), \\nwhich recommended as an action item in 2009 that phages be considered \\nalternatives to antibiotics. The body reiterated this view in March 2018 during a \\nmeeting at the CDC, where phages were identified as “an option that deserves to be \\ndiscussed across the Atlantic” (Viruses (2018) 10(6):288).  \\nMichael Higgins 212.409.2074\\nBiomX Inc. (PHGE)\\nPage 14\\nIn mid-2017, the FDA held a two-day workshop to discuss how to facilitate the \\ndevelopment of a rigorous clinical assessment of phage therapy. Topics included: the \\ndesign of clinical trials; CMC and regulatory pathways; the unique properties of \\nphages, including their PK properties; the challenges of regulating cocktails of phages \\nrather than individual phages; personalized cocktails; and the possibility of adding or \\nreplacing individual phages in an FDA approved cocktail to overcome resistance from \\nbacteria or immune neutralization. During this session, the FDA’s Dr. Scott Stibitz \\n(Chief, Laboratory of Mucosal Pathogens and Cellular Immunology at CBER/FDA) \\nmentioned that, despite phages being uncharted territory for the agency, “the FDA is \\ncommitted to facilitating the testing of phage therapy in clinical trials”. Indeed, 24 \\nphage therapy-based trials listed on ClinicalTrials.gov are now ongoing or completed \\n(see Exhibit 9), including one from pharmaceutical giant Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMY; \\n$63.81; Not Rated). Dr. Doran Fink, also from the FDA’s CBER, stated in regard to \\nphage therapies, “We do have initiatives for development and licensure of \\npersonalized medicine products… you can rely on the FDA to exercise regulatory \\nflexibility in its approach to these requirements”, mentioning examples such as \\nstreamlined and adaptive trial designs, use of animal data, and accelerated approval \\nbased on a surrogate efficacy endpoint. One of the most important views of the FDA \\nis it agrees that if a phage in the approved phage cocktail is changed to better match \\nany evolved target, only the CMC of the NDA would need to be reviewed, following in \\nvitro evidence of the phage-switch, which is similar to global regulators’ views on \\nseasonal influenza vaccines, and more recently, the agency’s emerging views on \\nCovid vaccines.  \\n2. \\nDevelopment and manufacturing go hand-in-hand. There are currently over a \\ndozen FDA-cleared phage-based products manufactured and sold on a commercial \\nscale for the agri-food business, including: Intralytix’s (private) LMP-102 (Listshileld), \\na cocktail of six natural phages, is used to eliminate Listeria monocytogenes from \\npoultry products; Micreos Food Safety’s PhageGuard S is approved for removal of E. \\ncoli O157:H7; and Omnilytics’ (owned by Phagelux, Inc. (private)) SalmoPro, a phage \\ncocktail used to remove Salmonella from meats, fruits and vegetables.  \\nDevelopment of phage-based products for any application require in-house \\nmanufacturing expertise to optimize the purifying, phage targeting and processing of \\nmaterials. Each test and retest of material counts as another manufacturing run, but \\ncontract manufacturing organizations (CMOs) are typically loath to take on \\nbacteriophage companies as clients because of the low cost of manufacture, and low \\nmargins. In 3Q’19, BiomX opened its own in-house, 550 sq. ft cGMP compliant \\nprocess development and manufacturing suite with scalability to fit the changing \\nneeds of clinical development and has multiple trusted third-party manufacturing \\npartners standing ready for large scale clinical and commercial production, should the \\nneed for outside assistance arise. \\nExhibit 12: Schematic of a standard phage manufacturing process \\n \\nSource: Viruses (2018) 10(10):537 \\nMichael Higgins 212.409.2074\\nBiomX Inc. (PHGE)\\nPage 15\\n3. \\nSynthetic material or combinatorial therapy provides prolonged patent \\nprotection. Based on the U.S. Supreme Court case of Diamond v. Chakrabarty, 447 \\nU.S. 303, patent protection is available for a microorganism that is artificially \\nconstructed rather than naturally occurring. Recent progress in genetic engineering \\nand DNA sequencing technologies has made it viable to pre-screen and modify \\nphages, which can then be patented (see Exhibit 13). Manufacturing processes for \\nphages can be patented due to the extensive processing and scaling as described \\nabove. Novel combinations of multiple natural phages for targeting one or more \\nbacteria may also be patented. For example, BiomX’s most advanced candidate \\nBX001 is a combination of multiple natural lytic phages, allowing for filing of a robust \\ncomposition patent extending out to 2038. \\nSynthetic biology can also help to engineer phages with enhanced properties that \\novercome some of the challenges naturally associated with phage therapies (Cold \\nSpring Harb Perspect Biol (2016) 8(10) pii: a023879; Biotechnol J (2016) 11(5):595-\\n600). Phage enhancements that would allow for patentability include broadening the \\nhost range through rational design of phage tail fibers; engineering phages to express \\nbacterial biofilm-degrading enzymes; designing mutations in the major capsid protein \\nthat are known to help phages avoid phagocytosis by macrophages; or packaging \\nmultiple bacterial killing mechanisms into the phage genome, which could also help \\navoid development of bacterial resistance. \\nExhibit 13: Examples of synthetic modifications of natural phages \\n \\nSource: Cold Spring Harb Perspect Biol (2016) 8(10) pii: a023879 \\n \\nExhibit 14: Potential mechanisms of bacterial resistance against phages \\n \\nSource: Appl Microbiol Biotechnol (2019) 103(5):2121-2131 \\n \\nMichael Higgins 212.409.2074\\nBiomX Inc. (PHGE)\\nPage 16\\n4. \\nBacterial resistance is ~a tenth as common with phages. While resistance \\ndevelopment is inevitable, the rate at which resistance occurs is ~10-fold slower \\nfollowing phage therapy compared with resistance development following antibiotic \\ntherapy (Arch Immunol Ther Exp (Warsz) (1999) 47(5):267-74). Bacteria develop \\nresistance \\nto \\nphages \\nthrough \\nseveral \\nmechanisms, \\nmost \\ncommonly \\nthe \\ndownregulation of cell surface molecules such as glycans and glycoconjugates, used \\nby phages for the initial attachment step (Number 2 in Exhibit 14; Appl Microbiol \\nBiotechnol (2019) 103(5):2121-2131).  \\n5. \\nTreating the most severe, life-threatening infections with a directed approach. \\nPhage researchers see the use of phages as an opportunity to turn a bacteria’s \\nresistance into an advantage (Cell Host Microbe (2019) 25(2):219-232), with the most \\nfamous case being that of Tom Patterson, infected with an MDR strain of A. \\nbaumannii (Antimicrob Agents Chemother (2017) 61(10). pii: e00954-17). The steps \\nto save Dr. Tom Patterson’s life generated a book “The Perfect Predator: A Scientist’s \\nRace to Save Her Husband From a Deadly Superbug”, co-written by his wife and \\ncolleague at UCSD, Dr. Steffanie Strathdee.  \\nThrough downregulation of its minocycline resistance mechanism, Mr. Patterson’s A. \\nbaumannii infection was resistant to all antibiotics tested and even to the original \\nbacteriophage cocktail deployed against it. But by selecting for this discovered \\nresistant strain through continued treatment of the infection with the first cocktail, \\nphage scientists were able to develop a second cocktail targeted specifically at this \\nnew mutant, ultimately ridding the patient of his infection. \\n6. \\nStripping biofilms of their resistance. Treating infections where biofilms are formed \\nis a major therapeutic challenge as the biofilms are extremely resistant to antibiotics, \\nand well protected against the immune system, which contribute toward their \\nincreased prevalence in chronic MDR infections. Most phages and phage \\ncombinations, such as BiomX’s BX001, penetrate biofilms and are being used in \\ncombination with antibiotics to improve outcomes (Front Microbiol (2017) 8:981; \\nJAMA (2017) 318(18):1746-1748).  \\n \\nBy isolating target-specific phages and combining phages with antibiotics (which can \\nbe expected against MDR pathogens), the potential for continued resistance \\nprogression is reduced (Front Microbiol (2014) 5:51). Most importantly to the patient, \\nis that the lytic (cidal) phage allows for prior, pre-resistant activity of the antibiotic to \\nreturn. In future decades, following continued clinical evidence, we see phages as a \\ncommon combination treatment along with antibiotics.  \\nPhages re-sensitize antibiotic-resistant bacteria to antibiotics by selecting phages that \\ntarget drug efflux pumps and other antibiotic resistance mechanisms. Several animal \\nstudies have described synergistic effects of phage/antibiotic combos, though the \\nexact mechanisms are not yet clear (Cell Host Microbe (2019) 25(2):219-232). The \\nbenefits of combining antibiotics and phages are also apparent in clinical case studies \\nsuch as that of Mr. Patterson, whose antibiotic regimen was maintained through the \\nphage treatment. We anticipate the synergies identified between phages and \\nantibiotics leads to combinatorial use, particularly following the first years of phage \\ntherapy approvals. \\nMichael Higgins 212.409.2074\\nBiomX Inc. (PHGE)\\nPage 17\\n7. \\nTargeting PK/PD characteristics for each disease. Unlike most antibiotics, most \\nphages can easily be tailored for the most appropriate delivery method. For example, \\nfor the eradication of Cutibacterium acnes on the face or MRSA in burn wounds a \\ntopical phage treatment is most appropriate. Meanwhile, Klebsiella infections in \\ninflammatory bowel diseases are most directly treated through oral phage treatments.  \\nWhile it is generally believed phages are degraded by the stomach’s acidic pH, \\nliterature suggests most phages are not affected by passage through the stomach \\nand any potential issues could be ameliorated through co-administration with acid \\nneutralizers (Med Res Rev (2019) 39(5):2000-2025). Small doses and the \\nsubsequent lack of side effects are often considered an advantage for phage \\ntherapies that can multiply at sites of infection, but we caution that without synthetic \\nmodification much of the phage payload would be neutralized by the immune system, \\nregardless of the route of administration.  \\nExhibit 15: Phages versus antibiotics comparisons; by activity and development stage \\n \\nSources: Cell Host Microbe (2019) 25(2):219-232; BiomX; Ladenburg Thalmann research \\n \\n \\nAntib.

BX001 – PRECLINICAL AND CLINICAL EVIDENCE \\nBX001’s preclinical evidence \\nHere, we review the rationale for BX001’s development, along with its preclinical and \\nclinical evidence, as well as our outlook for its ongoing Phase 2, which reads out in 3Q’21 \\n(8-week data) and 4Q’21 (12-week data).  \\nPreclinical data shows strong results. In our view, BiomX has generated impressive \\npreclinical evidence of activity, including safety, targeted efficacy, and biofilm activity. Its \\npreclinical studies were presented March 2020 at the American Academy of Dermatology \\nmeeting (https://www.biomx.com/publications/) and summarized below. BX001: \\n1. \\nIs specific to C. acnes strains without any impact on commensal strains or \\nproblematic in development of drug resistance.  \\n2. \\nIs able to destroy antibiotic-resistant strains alone and through biofilm.  \\n3. \\nDoes not cause significant irritation in an ex vivo skin model.  \\n1. \\nBX001s’ specificity to C. acnes. In a solid matrix assay, where bacteria are spread \\non an agar lawn and treated with specific therapies, phages comprising BX001 were \\nspecific to C. acnes strains CCUG 6369, CCUG 38584 and DSMZ 16379 (see Exhibit \\n17). In total, BX001 was found to be active against 96% of C. acnes strains tested. \\nImportantly, none of the three phages tested were active against C. granulosum or C. \\navidum, two other common commensal skin microbes. Also, unlike oral antibiotics, no \\nactivity was seen against S. aureus or S. epidermidis, indicating that not only is \\nBX001 safe for systemic use but is also significantly less likely to promote resistance \\nin non-target strains. \\n \\n \\n \\nMichael Higgins 212.409.2074\\nBiomX Inc. (PHGE)\\nPage 19\\n2. \\nOutperformance against standard antibiotics, regardless of biofilms. In another \\nsolid matrix assay, antibiotic-resistant C. acnes strains were spread on a plate and \\ntreated with clindamycin, erythromycin, four different individual phages and two \\ncombinations of those four phages. As expected, clindamycin and erythromycin had \\nno effect on eradicating the antibiotic-resistant C. acnes, while all individual phages \\nand both combinations cleared the bacteria from the assay plate.  \\n \\nThe outperformance against erythromycin was also demonstrated in a biofilm assay, \\nwhere three different phage cocktails were all able to eradicate >80% of C. acnes \\nbiofilms within 24 hours and 100% eradication within 48 hours. Conversely, \\nclindamycin cleared only ~30% by 48 hours. BiomX also showed the phage cocktails \\nwere able to penetrate sebum (the oily/waxy secretion of the sebaceous glands), \\nwhich is an important potential differentiator between BX001 and topical antibiotics \\n(Exhibit 19). \\n \\n3. \\nLittle irritation in ex vivo skin models. In the EpiDerm and EpiOcular models, \\nwhich are good laboratory practice (GLP) and Organization for Economic Co-\\noperation and Development (OECD) validated ex vivo, non-animal models, \\nmaintained native cell viability compared with the negative control (~90-100% \\nviability), even when tested at 10x and 100x the anticipated dose (see Exhibit 20).  \\n \\nIn a secondary permeation assay of a Franz cell system, BX001 did not permeate \\nthrough a synthetic membrane and was <0.0039% permeable through an epidermal \\ncell sheet. Though phages are known to be specific to one species, the prevention of \\nsystemic distribution is important for any therapy and should give confidence to \\npartners and consumers that the phage cocktail would have no unexpected systemic \\nside effects. \\nExhibit 17: Specificity of BX001 to C. acnes \\n \\nSource: BiomX, AAD Conference 2020, Poster #15863 \\n \\n \\n \\nMichael Higgins 212.409.2074\\nBiomX Inc.

In March 2020, BiomX announced \\ncompletion and positive results from its four-week, randomized, double-blind, three-arm, \\n75-patient Phase 1 trial. Acne patients received either placebo or one of two dose levels of \\nBX001 for once-daily topical administration over four weeks. C. acnes samples were taken \\nat baseline, two weeks, four weeks (final application) and at the five-week follow-up visit. \\nThe primary endpoint was safety and tolerability, with secondary efficacy endpoints \\nmeasuring the reduction of C. acnes and lesion count, plus a skin microbiome evaluation. \\nA diagram of the Phase 1 design is shown in Exhibit 21. \\nMichael Higgins 212.409.2074\\nBiomX Inc. (PHGE)\\nPage 21\\nPhase 1 safety. Both doses of BX001 met the primary endpoint of safety and tolerability \\nby demonstrating a similar number of subjects with all-causality or treatment-related \\nadverse events between all groups. In this 75-patient trial there were only four treatment-\\nrelated adverse events, and none more than once per patient: exfoliation; dryness; \\nerythema; and pruritus. There were no dropouts or serious AE’s.  \\nPhase 1 efficacy. In BX001’s high dose arm, C. acnes levels were reduced by 24% \\ncompared to baseline but increased by 26% in the placebo arm (p=0.036; see Exhibit 22). \\nThis was regardless of baseline C. acnes levels. In this overall study group BX001’s low \\ndose arm’s results were similar to placebo.  \\nEnrollment was stratified by baseline sebum levels (<>133ug/cm2), since there are \\nstudies that link higher sebum output with acne development (Br J Dermatol. 2007 \\nJan;156(1):22-31; Dermatoendocrinol. 2009 May;1(3):157-61). As shown in Exhibit 22, \\npatients randomized (1:1:1) to the high dose BX001 arm with high baseline sebum levels \\nshowed a 0.4 log difference in sebum levels vs. those with high baseline sebum levels but \\ntreated with placebo. For a small study, this is an important finding as it provides evidence \\nthat this targeted phage therapy reduces C. acnes, which is highly correlated with acne in \\nteenagers with acne.  \\nBX001’s low dose had no effect on C. acnes levels. Management has stated that it did \\nshow evidence in in vitro studies, but is 100-X lower than the “high dose” of BX001… \\nwhich has not been described by amount or concentration so far. On the other end of the \\nspectrum, BX001 has not reached a maximum tolerated dose (MTD), so we have little \\nconcern with the safety profile of this same “high dose” that has being taken into Phase 2.  \\nPhase 1’s preview of Phase 2. We are confident of BX001’s Phase 2 readout for week 4 \\ndata as the trial is enrolling 70 patients/arm (vs. 25 in Phase 1) and only those with \\n>133ug/cm2 baseline C. acnes levels. No difference was seen between BX001 doses and \\nplacebo for lesion count prior to four weeks, however this is a very difficult endpoint for \\nPhase 2 acne trials to demonstrate improvements at four weeks as it takes at least that \\nlong for the skin to rejuvenate and deeper acne wounds can take months to improve. The \\nfirst efficacy measurement of the ongoing Phase 2 is at 8 weeks, but the study also \\nincludes the important 12-week measurement, as regulators require 12-week studies for \\napproval, and it makes a comparison with this phage against Rx approved acne \\ntreatments more plausible.  \\nExhibit 21: Phase 1 trial design \\n \\nSource: BiomX corporate presentation, May 2020 \\nMichael Higgins 212.409.2074\\nBiomX Inc.

To better differentiate its product in the OTC acne market, BiomX is \\ntaking an uncommon and more aggressive move for an OTC product by testing BX001 in \\na large Phase 2. The rationale is to provide significant clinical efficacy data that could be \\nleveraged by its undisclosed global cosmetics partner. We note that BX001 could not \\nclaim acne fighting abilities on its OTC label because it is being marketed as a cosmetic \\nbut can say that it improves the appearance of acne prone skin and share the Phase 2 \\ndetails on the products’ website.  \\nThe Phase 2, which began dosing March 2021, is a randomized, placebo-controlled, \\ndouble-blind, two-arm (n=70/arm), 12-week trial with a one-week follow-up (see Exhibit \\n23). Importantly, the 12-week trial period should allow BiomX to assess IGA and lesion \\nnumbers more effectively. In our view, this is a sophisticated trial design for an OTC \\nproduct but in line with Phase 2’s of competitive acne products (Exhibits 9 and 24).  \\nThe Phase 2 has been affected by Covid, which delayed its expected 2H’20 start as well \\nas the trial size, from 100 to 140, per the recommendation of the undisclosed CRO that \\nfelt a higher than anticipated drop-out rate could develop if patients are not able to \\ncontinue returning to the clinic on time. We find this opportunity cost has been shared by \\nmany drug developers. Meanwhile, the additional cost for further recruitment has been \\ndescribed as “not excessive” by management given the expected dropouts.  \\nBiomX has so far shown BX001 is stable for up to nine months at room temperature and \\nlonger under refrigeration. The gel is “ready to use”, with no mixing involved for the patient. \\nFor BX001 to be considered a success in acne we would like to see inflammatory and \\nnon-inflammatory lesion count reductions of 20 to 25%, which are in line with the leading \\nacne treatments (Exhibit 24). These endpoints are the gold-standard among acne trials.  \\nMichael Higgins 212.409.2074\\nBiomX Inc.

Yet, acne remains one of the most stubborn dermatological conditions to \\nadequately treat as consumers/patients and their parents continue to buy products that \\nprovide minimal benefit versus simply washing the face with soap and water twice a day \\nand refraining from sugary foods and dairy products.  \\nWhile the characteristics of the acne market are fairly understood by investors, we believe \\nthe differences in the OTC vs. Rx markets are underappreciated by many. Here in “BX001 \\nMarket Opportunity” we outline the global and U.S. cosmetic and acne markets, \\ndemographics of acne sufferers, efficacy measures and pricing of >30 OTC and Rx acne \\ntreatments, the best-selling acne products, as well as the development time and revenues \\nof OTC vs. Rx acne treatments.  \\nUnlike most other medical conditions, the acne market is served by an overlapping blend \\nof prescription and OTC products (often same APIs in both) with patients using both OTC \\nand Rx products, with and without the reliance of a physician, which also varies but \\ntypically includes primary care, OBGYN and dermatologists. Not unlike other medical \\nconditions, adoption is primarily driven by price, but escalates quickly if the first acne \\ntreatment fails.  \\nAs shown in Exhibit 25, it should take ~four years to develop an OTC acne product. For \\nBiomX, it started in 1H’19 by completing its manufacturing process for BX001, started a \\nPhase 1 in late 2019, and due to Covid delays in 2020 is on target to complete the Phase \\n2 in 2H’21, secure its marketing agreement with its undisclosed global cosmetic partner by \\nearly 2022, scale up to commercial scale manufacturing procedures in 2022 and launch in \\n2023, or five years from concept to revenues. Meanwhile, the Rx route includes IND prep \\nand approval, plus pivotal trial execution, plus regulatory prep and approval. While the \\ngraphic shows seven years, this too would be delayed a year by Covid, for three more \\nyears than the OTC route. In terms of cost, that is primarily driven by the additional \\npatients needed for regulatory approval with the Rx route ~7X more expensive. In terms of \\npatient numbers, BiomX ran a larger Phase 1 (n=75) and is running a larger Phase 2 \\n(n=140) than shown in the company’s mid-2020 exhibit. On the Phase 2 sizing, \\nmanagement informed us that the trial size increased from its 100-patient estimate in 2020 \\nto 140 by YE’20 due to feedback from its undisclosed Contract Research Organization \\n(CRO), that due to Covid, to expect higher rates of dropouts. It chose the CRO based on \\nthe recommendation of its global cosmetics’ partner.  \\nExhibit 25: OTC vs. Rx development timelines and cost \\n \\nSource: BiomX’s July 2020 BX001 acne backgrounder presentation \\nMichael Higgins 212.409.2074\\nBiomX Inc.

As far back as \\n1998 (just following the sharp rise in new antibiotics in the 1990s), 62% of clinical C. \\nacnes (f.k.a P. acnes) isolates were already resistant to at least one major treatment \\n(e.g., clindamycin, tetracycline, or erythromycin). Dermatologists lean heavily on \\nantibiotics and represent almost half of antibiotic prescriptions, so it should come as \\nno surprise that resistance to these agents is >90% today (see Exhibit 26; Med J \\nAustr (1998) 169:259; J Eur Acad Dermatol Venereol (2013) 27(12):1546-51). \\n \\nResistance to antibiotics is lower outside the U.S. Still, there are international \\ncalls for a restriction on antibiotic use, with one set of authors across three continents \\ncalling for “a time limit for [antibiotic] use plus the employment of non-antibiotic \\nmaintenance”, concluding that “a number of novel treatments awaiting clinical proof \\nmay include the use of bacteriophages” (Am J Clin Dermatol (2020) 21(6):813-819; J \\nEur Acad Dermatol Venereol (2020) DOI:10.1111/jdv.17099). Given the history of \\nphages, we are not surprised to find greater interest in the use of phages coming from \\nEurope. Per our calculations (from Exhibit 26), the average rate of resistance to four \\nkey antibiotics is roughly half the rate in Europe (32%) as it is in the United States \\n(70%).  \\nExhibit 26: Antibiotic susceptibility of C. acnes varies by region \\n \\nSources: J Drugs Dermatol. 2011 10 7 724 733; J Clin Aesthet Dermatol. 2011 4 5 22 26; J Eur Acad \\nDermatol Venereol. 2013 Dec;27(12):1546-51; and BiomX July 2020 presentation.

Globally, the dermatological market is currently the 9th largest major \\npharmaceutical category, bringing in ~$17.3 billion in 2020 sales with an expected \\ncompounded annual growth rate (CAGR) of 17.0% to reach $45.4B in 2026 (per \\nEvaluatePharma [EP]; see Exhibit 27). This almost tripling in size in six years is \\nastounding, as the derm category is expected to increase from the 9th to the 5th \\nbiggest category in just six years.  \\n \\nGlobally, there are ~665 million people with acne each year, or ~9.5% of the global \\npopulation (Sci Rep (2020) 10:5754). By 2024, over 20% of the global dermatology \\nmarket is estimated to be composed of acne products, for a total market of ~$7 billion.  \\n \\nWe find the primary drivers have been, and should continue to favor the derm \\ncategory, as higher income countries age and have relatively more financial flexibility \\nto take care of their skin. We believe coming out of Covid should also help the \\ncategory near-term.  \\nCountry\\nClindamycin\\nErythromycin\\nOxytetracycline\\nDoxycycline\\nAverage\\nUnited States\\n79\\n81\\n63\\n57\\n70\\nSpain\\n91\\n91\\n5\\n0\\n47\\nGreece\\n75\\n75\\n7\\n0\\n39\\nUnited Kingdom\\n55.5\\n55.5\\n26.4\\n0\\n34\\nEgypt\\n65\\n48\\n18\\n6\\n34\\nIran\\n50\\n52\\n35\\n0\\n34\\nSingapore\\n>50\\n>50\\n>11.5\\n>11.5\\n>31\\nItaly\\n58\\n58\\n0\\n0\\n29\\nNorthern Mexico\\n36\\n46\\n14\\n20\\n29\\nHong Kong\\n53.5\\n20.9\\n16.3\\n16.3\\n27\\nSweden\\n45\\n45\\n15\\n0\\n26\\nFrance\\n0\\n75.1\\n9.5\\n9.5\\n24\\nHungary\\n45\\n45\\n0\\n0\\n23\\nJapan\\n4\\n4\\n2\\n2\\n3\\nMichael Higgins 212.409.2074\\nBiomX Inc.

Acne is the most common skin condition as it \\nannually affects >50 million people, or 12-15% of the population (J Am Acad Dermatol \\n(2006) 55(3):490-500). Of these, ~10% seek the care of a physician.  \\n \\nApproximately 85% of 12-to-24-year-olds experience at least minor acne, which \\npersists into the 20s and 30s for 64% and 43% of individuals, respectively, numbers \\nthat are increasing (Br J Dermatol (2013) 168(3):474-85; Skin Pharmacol Physiol \\n(2014) 27(suppl 1):3-8). The incidence of acne is hereditary, as it is found in almost \\n80% of first-degree relatives. There is evidence that acne is associated with diets \\nhigher in glycemic content, certain dairy products, and refined sugars (Skin Therapy \\nLett (2010) 15(3):1-2; Cutis (2011) 88(2):84-91). A correlation with depression has \\nbeen identified, with 18.5% and 12% of those with and without acne, respectively, \\nhaving major depressive disorder (Br J Dermatol (2018) 178(3):e194-e195).  \\n \\nWe believe Covid-19 forced many prescription acne consumers to try online OTC \\nacne treatments as they could not reach their physician for first-time or follow-up visits. \\nAlso, new patients that would have seen a physician for their acne in 2020 also tilted \\nthe balance toward OTC acne products. It will be interesting to see, but we believe \\nthe OTC acne market benefited from the pandemic. During the 2020 earnings calls of \\nsome major cosmetics brands, there is evidence of a shift from in-store to online \\nsales. For example, L’Oréal posted a -5% YoY sales drop (driven by the lack of social \\nand work gatherings), but a 50% increase in online sales. If this change is sustainable, \\ndue to increased COVID-19 risk or shifting consumer preferences, we may find this \\nphenomenon will lead to greater reliance on OTC acne treatments than otherwise.  \\n \\n4. \\nThe acne treatment landscape. We believe there are >300 specific acne treatment \\nregimens, most of which include some combination of active pharmaceutical \\ningredients (APIs), evidenced by a U.S. Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality \\nreview that found 274 ongoing trials of 140 treatments in 250 combinations (Lancet \\n(2012) 379:361). More common that other diseases, people seem to resist seeing a \\nphysician, with 40% of people doing nothing for their acne, 30% using OTC products, \\n20% see a skin care center and just 10% see a physician.  \\n \\nTreatment guidelines; BPO preference. Numerous clinical treatment guidelines \\nexist that are often region-dependent (J Am Acad Dermatol (2003) 49:S1–37; Eur J \\nDermatol (2004) 14:391–99; J Am Acad Dermatol (2007) 56:651–63), but most \\nguidelines advise topical benzoyl peroxide (BPO) as a first line option due to its low \\n2020\\n2026\\n1 Immunosuppressants\\n24.6\\n68.4\\n19%\\n2 Dermatological\\n17.3\\n45.4\\n17%\\n3 Oncology\\n157.5\\n325.2\\n13%\\n4 Vaccines\\n34.1\\n63.3\\n11%\\n5 Sensory organs\\n22.4\\n32.3\\n6%\\n6 Anti-diabetics\\n53.4\\n70.2\\n5%\\n7 Bronchodilators\\n14.2\\n17.0\\n3%\\n8 Anti-virals\\n40.2\\n42.7\\n1%\\n9 Anti-coagulants\\n25.2\\n23.0\\n0%\\n10 Anti-rheumatics\\n49.4\\n32.2\\n-7%\\nTherapy Area\\nWW Sales ($B)\\nCAGR\\nMichael Higgins 212.409.2074\\nBiomX Inc.

For this reason, BPO is the most \\ncommonly used active ingredient in acne medications (Cochrane Database of \\nSystematic Reviews (2020) 3:CD011154). Interestingly though, according to a recent \\nCochrane analysis of 29,592 participants randomized in 116 trials: \\n\\uf0b7 \\n“…BPO as monotherapy or add-on treatment may be more effective than \\nplacebo or no treatment for improving acne, and there may be little to no \\ndifference between BPO and either adapalene or clindamycin.” \\n\\uf0b7 \\n“For adverse effects, the evidence is very uncertain regarding BPO compared \\nwith adapalene, erythromycin, or salicylic acid. However, risk of treatment \\ndiscontinuation may be higher with BPO compared with placebo or no treatment \\n(RR 2.13, 95% CI 1.55 to 2.93). Withdrawal may be linked to tolerability rather \\nthan to safety. Risk of mild to moderate adverse events may be higher with BPO \\ncompared with clindamycin.” \\nTo us, it is clear that the authors of the Cochrane analysis respect the efficacy of \\nbenzoyl peroxide, but the efficacy comes at the cost of tolerability. In our view, \\ntolerability needs to be excellent for any acne medication, especially since it takes at \\nleast one month before the majority of the efficacy from an acne medication can be \\nseen. Since it is phage, BX001 does not include any skin permeation technology (not \\nneeded), we believe BX001 will be one of the  best tolerated acne medications \\navailable.  \\nAn established range of premium priced OTC acne meds. While Exhibit 28 \\nprovides an almost overwhelming amount of information, in our view the key \\ntakeaways include the wide range of prices for Rx acne medications, even within \\ngeneric and branded products. Also, the highest priced products have not necessarily \\nshown the greatest reductions in inflammatory lesion counts. Rather, the right half of \\nthose listed in Exhibit 29 are not only more expensive but have similar maximum and \\nminimum lesion count reductions to each other (55-60% and 45-55%, respectively), \\nthan those available but less expensive acne meds.  \\nIf we compute a mean price / lesion change we find more value among the less \\nexpensive acne meds, which is in-line with the range of high-quality OTC brands such \\nas Rodan + Fields that sell between $100-200. To us, this suggests that should \\nBX001 demonstrate impressive efficacy it will have strong pricing power in the OTC \\nmarket. While we don’t expect consumers are pricing the value of acne medications \\nas we are, we do expect a lot of communication between them and an appreciation \\nfor those in the established $100-$200 range where we expect BX001 to compete \\nvery well.  \\nMichael Higgins 212.409.2074\\nBiomX Inc.

Given the pricing information in Exhibit 28, it will be \\ninteresting to see BX001’s pricing, if BiomX’s partner takes the more aggressive \\napproach of Retin-A Micro or Aczone, or a more conservative approach. Given the \\nmean price / lesion change information we’ve shown, we believe we are more likely to \\nfind BX001 will be within the range of high-quality OTC brands ($100-200; we model \\n$150). We expect that pricing decision to be driven by the large, undisclosed \\ncosmetics partner.  \\nPaying for new, novel acne meds. As shown in Exhibits 28 and 32, retinoids, \\nbenzoyl peroxide and clindamycin products are the most common active ingredients, \\nwhich we know are not new, novel or differentiated from other acne meds. In a market \\nwith >300 options and a high degree of unmet need amongst refractory acne patients, \\nwe expect BX001’s adoption to benefit from its uncommon novelty, especially since it \\nis considered a natural product.  \\nAcne meds work differently. As we continue to review acne treatment landscape, \\nit’s worth noting that acne medications work in a variety of ways, including: reducing \\noil production; fighting bacterial infection; reducing inflammation; and/or speeding up \\nskin cell turnover (Exhibits 30 and 31). Only isotretinoin has shown evidence on all \\nmajor acne treatment categories but is reserved for severe patients due to the high \\nskin irritation levels and contraindication in pregnancy. Given it takes 28 days for skin \\nto turnover, the majority of the visible benefits occur at least four to eight weeks after \\nthe start of dosing. \\nExhibit 30: Acne medications’ strengths and weaknesses \\n \\nSource: Lancet (2012) 379:361 \\nMaximum\\nMinimum\\nMaximum\\nMinimum\\nRetin-A Micro\\nRetinoid\\n$863\\n$785\\n49.0%\\n32.0%\\n2,035\\nAczone\\nDapsone\\n$744\\n$495\\n56.0%\\n54.0%\\n1,126\\nOnextron\\nClindamycin + BPO\\n$628\\n$539\\n--\\n60.4%\\n966\\nEpiduo Forte\\nRetinoid + BPO\\n$602\\n$507\\n--\\n68.7%\\n807\\nAcanya\\nClindamycin + BPO\\n$573\\n$528\\n55.1%\\n54.2%\\n1,007\\nZiana Gel\\nClindamycin + Ret.\\n$408\\n$370\\n61.0%\\n48.0%\\n714\\nDuac\\nClindamycin + BPO\\n$381\\n$356\\n57.0%\\n32.0%\\n828\\nErygel\\nErythromycin\\n$191\\n$22\\n--\\n--\\n--\\nEpiduo\\nRetinoid + BPO\\n$138\\n$69\\n53.4%\\n36.0%\\n232\\nAltreno\\nRetinoid\\n$130\\n$115\\n47.5%\\n45.6%\\n263\\nRetin-A\\nRetinoid\\n$95\\n$86\\n--\\n--\\n--\\nTherapy\\nActive compound\\nPricing\\nInflammatory lesion change\\nPrice/lesion \\nchange\\nMichael Higgins 212.409.2074\\nBiomX Inc.

Not surprisingly, we found acne \\nmedications respond very well to digital marketing. According to a study published in \\n2020 (Pediatr Dermatol (2020) 37(2):301-304), digital marketing is a very powerful \\nand efficient means to market acne medications, with distinct demographics to \\nsupport a targeted approach and support a high ROI:  \\n\\uf0b7 \\n45% of respondents (patients) consulted social media for acne treatment \\nadvice, with a conversion rate of 81% for OTC medications and 40% for \\ndietary modifications.  \\n\\uf0b7 \\nLikelihood of changing their acne regimen based on digital ads: \\no \\nWomen (54%) are more likely than men (31%). \\no \\nAdults (51%) are slightly more likely than adolescents (41%). \\n\\uf0b7 \\nIndividuals consulted YouTube and Instagram the most (58% each).  \\nAccording to this research, only 31% of the treatments used were in line with \\nAmerican Academy of Dermatology Guidelines.  \\n \\nCategories\\nDrug examples\\nDescriptions\\nRetinoids and similar\\nInclude\\ntretinoin\\n(Avita,\\nRetin-A,\\nothers),\\nadapalene\\n(Differin)\\nand\\ntazarotene (Tazorac, Avage).

Consumers of OTC acne \\nmedications are impartial to active ingredients as long as efficacy is established (Clin \\nCosmet Investig Dermatol (2015) 8:231–238), meaning positive acne data produced \\nby BiomX coupled with a pricing scheme in line with the more expensive acne \\nmedications should, in our view, generate revenues in line with the best-selling acne \\ntreatments. Over 56 million units were sold among the top 10 OTC products in 2019 \\n(Drug Store News, August 26, 2019). \\n \\n5. \\nRevenue projections for BX001. In generating our BX001 revenue estimates (see \\nExhibit 33), we are looking for Phase 2 results largely in line with the Phase 1 readout \\nwith BX001 becoming a Top 10 acne medication globally by 2030. Over the past 40 \\nyears, it’s been very uncommon to have a novel acne medication. Last year, \\nCassiopea (SKIN.SW; CHF50.00; Not Rated) gained FDA approval for its novel \\nprescription acne treatment Winlevi (clascoterone cream), but this was the first novel \\nacne med since 1982’s Accutane (isotretinoin).  \\n \\nHowever, unlike both of these treatments BX001 is a natural product. We believe that \\nas a targeted phage therapy its “all natural” description (or similar) will greatly \\nenhance its profile amongst those suffering from acne and already frustrated with \\ntheir current regimens.  \\n \\nWe expect BiomX’s partner to target refractory patients, but also patients willing and \\nable to try a more expensive OTC product. We speculate it will be marketed, at least \\npartially, as skin enhancer as well. We discuss potential partners in the next section.  \\n \\nOur BX001 revenue estimates are primarily based off the estimates of the best-selling \\nacne products (given its “all natural” profile), the likely Phase 2 data and the profile of \\nits undisclosed global cosmetics partner. We expect its pricing to be in the range of \\npremium OTC acne products.  \\n \\nWhile acne is a very large market, we note that there remains a group of refractory \\npatients that are willing to pay up for a more expensive treatment, as long as it is \\neffective in returning acne-prone skin to clean, acne-free skin. With C. acnes high in \\nsebum content and BX001 having the ability to reduce/eliminate it, we have \\nconfidence BX001 can deliver on its efficacy in the real world and equally important, \\ndo so without the burning and redness associated with the most effective acne \\nmedications.  \\nExhibit 32: Best-selling topical prescription acne products, globally 2019-2026 \\n \\nSources: Evaluate Pharma and Ladenburg Thalmann research \\n \\nProduct\\nActive\\nCompany\\nLaunch\\n2020\\n2021\\n2022\\n2023\\n2024\\n2025\\n2026\\nEpiduo\\nadapalene/  \\nbenzoyl peroxide Galderma\\n2008\\n$304\\n$337\\n$354\\n$371\\n$388\\n$405\\n$421\\nClearasil\\nbenzoyl peroxide \\nor salicylic acid\\nReckitt Benckiser\\n1950\\n$297\\n$328\\n$340\\n$352\\n$364\\n$376\\n$389\\nWinlevi\\nclascoterone\\nCassiopea\\n2020\\nna\\n$28\\n$107\\n$180\\n$246\\n$272\\n$308\\nSeysara\\nsarecycline\\nAlmirall\\n2018\\n$21\\n$59\\n$94\\n$125\\n$151\\n$168\\n$185\\nAmzeeq\\nminocycline\\nVYNE Therapeutics\\n2020\\nna\\n$46\\n$73\\n$93\\n$113\\n$132\\n$149\\nAsepxia\\nsalicylic acid\\nGenomma Lab Internacional\\n1998\\n$50\\n$58\\n$64\\n$70\\n$76\\n$83\\n$90\\nDuac\\nbenzoyl peroxide GlaxoSmithKline\\n2002\\n$78\\n$82\\n$82\\n$81\\n$80\\n$80\\n$79\\nTargadox\\ndoxycycline\\nFortress Biotech\\n1967\\n$43\\n$44\\n$34\\n$29\\n$30\\n$32\\n$35\\nIsotretinoin isotretinoin\\nTeva Pharmaceutical Industries\\n2003\\n$37\\n$36\\n$35\\n$33\\n$32\\n$31\\n$30\\nOther\\n$484\\n$399\\n$323\\n$304\\n$292\\n$283\\n$298\\nTotal\\n$1,313\\n$1,420\\n$1,525\\n$1,680\\n$1,839\\n$1,941\\n$2,078\\nAnnual growth\\n8.2%\\n7.3%\\n10.2%\\n9.5%\\n5.6%\\n7.1%\\nIn $M; Ranked by EvaluatePharma\\'s projected 2026 sales; None of these companies are covered by Ladenburg Thalmann\\nMichael Higgins 212.409.2074\\nBiomX Inc. (PHGE)\\nPage 32\\nBX001 royalty revenues. BiomX has stated it intends to partner BX001, which we \\nexpect will almost exclusively benefit BiomX via royalty revenues. We look for \\nescalating royalties, 7-9%, given the terms of other cosmetic industry transactions, \\nthe stage of development and the quality of and uniqueness of clinical data.  \\n \\nWhile patent expiration is currently expected in 2038, we are not looking for a patent \\ncliff from this OTC product any more than other acne treatments, especially since \\nBiomX’s phage cocktail largely rests on unpatented manufacturing trade secrets. \\nMost important in OTC products is the brand name recognition and reputation, so we \\nlook for BX001 to be a Top 10 selling product for generations to come.  \\n \\nWe anticipate BiomX’s cosmetics partner will market BX001 as an acne product with \\nhigher scientific rigor than others and on its website/digital marketing will lean on the \\nclinical data and all-natural phage platform with unique and safe abilities to address \\nspecific patient needs. The education of dermatologists is also likely to be expected, \\nas physicians understand both the science and the patient need. Among others, \\nL’Oréal (OR.PA; ϵ339.15; NR) and Estee Lauder (EL; $304.39; NR) for example have \\ntens of thousands of dermatology reps plus connections with dermatologists as \\nconsultants and brand ambassadors for its higher-end skincare products.  \\n \\n3. \\nBiomX’s potential global partner. Despite its OTC status, the cosmetic acne market \\nis extremely large financially and dominated by entrenched players. The worldwide \\ncosmetics market is ~$205 billion, with skin care, at ~$80 billion, also the fastest \\ngrowing segment at an 8.0% CAGR. Even with acne only making up ~5% of the \\ncosmetic skin care market, it still amounts to $4 billion in annual sales, exceeding the \\nprescription market ($3.7 billion). Revenues from specific branded acne skincare \\nproducts are large enough for the largest skincare companies to be interested. For \\nexample, L’Oréal’s 9.5% market share in cosmetics generated $380 million in 2019, \\nwhile its top-selling topical brand Clearasil generated $284 million in revenues.  \\n \\nIt is also important to highlight the global nature of the cosmetics and OTC markets \\nand why it is so important BiomX has chosen to partner BX001 with a global \\ncosmetics company. Again, using L’Oréal as a proxy, the company highlighted in its \\n2019 Annual Report that Asia Pacific accounted for 41% of its business and that 40% \\nof its revenue came from the Skincare business segment. With only 21% of its \\nrevenues coming from North America, L’Oréal therefore generated 79% of its \\nSkincare revenue ex-U.S. accounting for almost a third of total annual company \\nrevenue, highlighting the importance of diverse markets in skin health. Additionally, \\nlarger companies have assorted products on offer, therefore  BiomX’s partner is also \\nincentivized by an additional revenue stream from BX001 that would complement, not \\ncannibalize, its current cosmetic offerings. \\n \\nWe cannot rule out an outright acquisition of BX001 following positive Phase 2 data, \\nas there are precedents for revenue-generating dermatology companies to be \\nacquired by larger players in the field, for example:  \\n\\uf0b7 \\nThe Covergirl unit Coty, purchased Younique, a DTC cosmetics company for \\n$1 billion. Also, Coty invested $600 million in Jenner Cosmetics for a 51% \\nstake, both of which boasted a heavy social media following. \\n\\uf0b7 \\nProactiv is one of the more high-profile examples, having been started in \\n1995 by Drs. Katie Rodan and Kathy Fields, two Stanford-trained \\ndermatologists.

BX003 FOR TREATMENT OF IBD AND PSC \\nBiomX is developing BX003 against specific clades of Klebsiella pneumoniae, a gram-\\nnegative, encapsulated, non-motile bacterium of the Enterobacteriaceae family (Acta \\nPaediatr (2019) 108(1):76-82). Originally discovered in 1882 in the lungs of patients who \\nhad died of pneumonia, Klebsiella is now known to be mainly concentrated in the \\ngastrointestinal tract of up to 38% of individuals in the general community and up to 77% \\nof individuals in hospital settings. This latter point is a major reason K. pneumoniae have \\ndeveloped resistance mechanisms against classic antibiotics such as extended-spectrum \\nbeta \\nlactams; \\nfor \\nexample, \\nas \\nof \\n2013 \\n80% \\nof \\nall \\ncarbapenem-resistant \\nEnterobacteriaceae infections were a result of K. pneumoniae (Front Microbiol (2018) \\n9:1463; Euro Surveill (2018) 23(32)). \\nLike any classic bacillus, Klebsiella are significantly more virulent in encapsulated form \\n(Exhibit 34). The polysaccharide outer capsule allows the bacterium to escape antibody-\\nmediated phagocytosis in patient serum. Virulence factors such as fimbriae, which allow \\nthe organism to attach itself to host cells, and siderophores, iron-acquiring molecules that \\naid in organism propagation, are upregulated following infection. Perhaps most importantly \\nfor disease severity is the lipopolysaccharide (LPS) layer of the bacterium, which, when \\nsensed by the innate immune system, turns on an inflammatory cascade that could lead to \\nsepsis and septic shock (Microbiol Mol Biol Rev (2016) 80:629–661). While the organism’s \\nname implies infection of the lungs, it should be noted that 52 separate genes (1.04% of \\nthe total genome) are specific to infection and virulence of the GI tract and liver (Journal of \\nBacteriology (2012) 194(22):6316; Microbiol Mol Biol Rev (2016) 80:629–661).  \\nExhibit 34: Virulence factors of Klebsiella pneumoniae \\n \\n \\n \\nSource: Microbiol Mol Biol Rev (2016) 80:629–661 \\nBecause of the factors outlined above, the World Health Organization has now recognized \\nK. pneumoniae as a common culprit in GI disease (J Dig Dis (2018) 19(5):262-271), which \\nhas led BiomX to develop BX003 to help treat inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and \\nprimary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC). \\n\\uf0b7 \\nIBD is a collection of GI disorders such as Crohn’s (CD) and ulcerative colitis \\n(UC) that can cause diarrhea, bloating and constipation; if left untreated, \\ncomplications can include malnutrition and cancer.  \\n\\uf0b7 \\nPSC causes inflammation and scarring of the bile ducts, which impedes the flow \\nof bile from the gall bladder to the liver.  \\nMichael Higgins 212.409.2074\\nBiomX Inc. (PHGE)\\nPage 36\\nIBD can cause extensive extraintestinal manifestations in the liver and gall bladder, of \\nwhich PSC is the most correlated, particularly in patients with UC (Gastroenterology Res \\n(2018) 11(2): 83–94). Further, K. pneumoniae has been implicated in IBD (UC and CD) as \\nwell as PSC (and other liver disorders; Science (2017) 358(6361):359-365) (Exhibit 35).  \\nExhibit 35: Abundance of Klebsiella is notably increased in UC, CD, and PSC \\npatients \\n \\n \\n \\nCD = Crohn’s disease; GERD =  gastroesophageal reflux disease; PSC = primary sclerosing \\ncholangitis; UC = ulcerative colitis; Source: Science (2017) 358(6361):359-365 \\n \\nClinical development plan: IBD/PSC. In early February 2021, BiomX announced \\npositive results from its Phase 1a PK study in IBD/PSC, testing the delivery of oral BX003 \\ntherapy (Exhibit 36). The Phase 1a was a 3-day MAD study looking at safety and \\ntolerability in healthy volunteers, with an additional analysis of viable phage in stool. The \\ncompany used a liquid oral formulation that was anticipated to lead to a ~2-log-fold \\ndecrease in active phage when the formulation reaches the gut. To remedy this, the \\ncompany simultaneously administered proton pump inhibitors (PPI) to decrease stomach \\nacid (Med Res Rev (2019) 39(5):2000-2025); future trials and commercial product will \\nutilize lyophilized phage and not require PPI use. By finding active phage in stool the \\ncompany believes this serves as a proxy that phage is reaching the intestines and \\ntherefore the Klebsiella infection. \\nExhibit 36: Trial design and results for BX003 in HVs \\n \\n \\n \\n \\nSource: BiomX March 2021 Corporate presentation \\n \\n \\nMichael Higgins 212.409.2074\\nBiomX Inc. (PHGE)\\nPage 37\\nThe study demonstrated safety and tolerability with successful delivery of a high \\nconcentration of viable phage to the lower gastrointestinal tract (Exhibit 36). Importantly, \\nviable phage delivered was ~1,000 times higher than the bacterial burden of K. \\npneumoniae in IBD patients. We note this is the first clinical study detailing the \\npharmacokinetics of oral phage therapy under a U.S. FDA IND protocol, highlighting the \\ninnovative nature of BiomX and its platform. Following this study BX003 was optimized to \\ninclude phage from BX002, its predecessor phage cocktail, to broaden the target bacterial \\nrange. This new broader cocktail is being taken into the Phase 1b/2a and provides \\nopportunities for BiomX to use BX003 in other Klebsiella infections. \\nUpcoming Phase 1b/2a. BiomX intends to start a Phase 1b/2a in 2H’21 with data \\nexpected in 2Q’22. This four-week, placebo-controlled trial in 60 patients is measuring \\nsafety and efficacy as primary endpoints (details not yet available), with important \\nsecondary endpoints such as reduction of K. pneumoniae. \\nThe company is running a Phase 1b/2a rather than a Phase 2 and will enroll both healthy \\nand diseased patients. Approximately 30-35% of people carry K. pneumoniae, so the \\nbacterial reduction endpoint can still be determined regardless of patient population. We \\nanticipate this decision is to speed enrollment since the company does not need to enroll \\nIBD/PSC to prove proof-of-mechanism, especially during COVID. \\nBiomarker available. Most interesting in our view is BiomX’s use of a screening assay to \\ndetermine patients susceptible to phage therapy. Stool is gathered and subjected to \\nphage transfected with green fluorescent protein (GFP), a marker protein that glows in the \\npresence of a predefined trigger. GFP in phage will glow if the phage encounter K. \\npneumoniae in patient stool. This assay is simple, cheap, and fast, which should help \\ndecrease costs and increase throughput.  \\nDespite certain companies facing issues in recruiting for clinical trials given the \\nenvironment around COVID-19, we do not anticipate BiomX has any trouble recruiting \\npatients for its IBD or PSC trial(s) since the number of carbapenem-resistant \\nEnterobacteriaceae infections has continued through the pandemic. We remind investors \\nthat up to 80% of carbapenem-resistant infections are caused by K. pneumoniae, and that \\nthe CDC does not include details from non-resistant strains which infect significantly more \\nof the general population, indicating significantly larger patient numbers than tracked by \\nthe CDC. \\nJustification for phages in IBD. As previously indicated, K. pneumoniae is becoming \\nincreasingly implicated in the spread of antibiotic resistance, particularly in hospitals \\n(nosocomial infections) following solid organ transplant where over 50% of infections have \\nbeen found to be extended-spectrum beta lactamase (ESBL)-producing strains \\n(Transplant Proc (2010) 42(8):2941-3). When these strains colonize the gut, they induce T \\nhelper 1 (TH1) cell responses such as upregulation of the inflammatory cytokine IFNᵧ, \\nleading to significantly increased disease progression (Science (2017) 358(6361):359-\\n365). This proinflammatory environment induces dysbiosis in the host, leading to higher K. \\npneumoniae due to less competition, further exacerbating the infection. \\nBiomX has developed a phage cocktail that decreases the concentration of K. \\npneumoniae in vivo. Mice studies showed significant (p<0.001) reduction in colony forming \\nunits (CFUs) of Klebsiella per gram of stool following optimization of a second-generation \\nphage cocktail (BX003; Exhibit 38); significant reductions were also seen in tissue mucosa. \\nThe cocktail approach allows BiomX to overcome the potential for resistance, and could \\nallow the company to target multiple components, including external virulence factors, on \\ndifferent K. pneumoniae clades.  \\n \\n \\nMichael Higgins 212.409.2074\\nBiomX Inc.

Primary sclerosing \\ncholangitis (PSC) is a heterogeneous liver disease characterized by biliary inflammation \\nand fibrosis (Exhibit 39). It is a risk factor for colon, bile-duct, and gallbladder cancers, and \\noverlaps significantly with IBD (70-80% of PSC patients have IBD).  \\nPSC is also a persistent and progressive illness with no approved treatment, leading \\npatients to often require liver transplants; recurrence occurs in up to 25% of patients \\nfollowing transplantation (N Engl J Med (2016) 375:1161-70). Bacterial cholangitis is \\nreported as the initial symptom in only ~6% of patients (Am J Gastroenterol (2007) \\n102(5):1042-9), though the contribution of bacterial dysbiosis and infection on the \\nprogression of PSC is likely significantly underappreciated (Nat Microbiol (2019) 4(3):492-\\n503). \\nMichael Higgins 212.409.2074\\nBiomX Inc. (PHGE)\\nPage 39\\nExhibit 39: Pathogenesis of PSC \\n \\nSources: N Engl J Med (2016) 375:1161-70 and Ladenburg Thalmann research \\nBacterial presence in the portal vein and increased levels of endotoxins in cholangiocytes \\nare commonly seen in patients presenting with PSC regardless of preliminary bacterial \\ncholangitis diagnosis. While there is significant overlap of PSC with IBD, the reverse is not \\ntrue, meaning inflammation alone could not be causing most PSC cases. Additionally, \\npatients presenting with epithelial barrier disruption secondary to other disorders such as \\nUC show gut microbiota-mediated TH17 cell increases, resulting in liver inflammation \\nsimilar to PSC (Gastroenterology Res (2018) 11(2): 83–94; Nat Microbiol (2019) 4(3):492-\\n503). From these observations, researchers later discovered patients with PSC-\\nassociated UC demonstrate right-sided colitis and minimal rectal inflammation (contrary to \\nthe significant inflammation occurring from the rectum in normal UC), and that gut \\nmicrobiota from PSC/UC is distinct from standard UC, similar to the dysbiosis seen in IBD \\npatients as described above (Inflamm Bowel Dis (2009) 15(9):1331-6; Gut (2017) \\n66(4):611-619). \\nIn germ-free mice infected with stool from PSC/UC patients, K. pneumoniae were found in \\nabundance in lymph nodes and were demonstrated as the causative agent behind \\nepithelial barrier disruption, TH17-mediated immune responses, and liver inflammation \\n(Nat Microbiol (2019) 4(3):492-503). Cholangiocytes respond to these pathogen-\\nassociated molecular patterns (PAMPs) by releasing their own suite of inflammatory \\nmolecules such as IFNᵧ, IL-6 and IL-8, further exacerbating the disease (J Biol Chem \\n(2011) 286:30352-60). \\nBiomX is targeting K. pneumoniae within the intestinal tract of PSC patients. K. \\npneumoniae clades have been shown to be necessary and sufficient to cause gut \\ndysbiosis and liver inflammation, leading to, and driving progression of, PSC (Exhibit 40).  \\nBiomX intends to dose patients with BX003, a phage cocktail targeted at a broad \\nspectrum of K. pneumoniae. While K. pneumoniae in an IBD model is primarily pro-\\ninflammatory and can be identified by the induction of IL-17 release in vivo, K. \\npneumoniae in a PSC model are pore-forming organisms that burrow through the gut \\nlining and can be differentiated through increased CFU in the lymph nodes and elevated \\nliver enzymes in animal models (Exhibit 41). Despite these differences, BiomX has been \\nable to develop a single phage cocktail to tackle multiple indications due to similarities K. \\npneumoniae displays. \\nMichael Higgins 212.409.2074\\nBiomX Inc.

For BiomX, this could provide \\nadditional opportunities for physicians to screen for right-sided colitis and lack of rectal \\ninflammation, increasing the possibility patients would be diagnosed Klebsiella-induced \\nPSC. We believe this standard of care, plus the confirmatory, non-invasive CDx described \\nin the IBD section, could lead to significantly more patients being diagnosed with K. \\npneumoniae infections and subsequently treated with BX003. \\nMichael Higgins 212.409.2074\\nBiomX Inc.

IBD is a very large market, with the CDC citing that 1.3% of \\nthe adult population (~3 million people) have reported they have been diagnosed with IBD; \\nextrapolating this to all ages brings the total patients to ~4.3 million people. We estimate \\nBiomX targets patients that are at higher risk of progression to PSC, which is ~57% of the \\ntotal IBD population (~2.5 million people) and aligns well with the estimated prevalence of \\nIBD patients according to the Crohn’s and Colitis Foundation of America (CCFA Factbook \\n2014). With approximately 38% of these patients harboring potentially injurious Klebsiella \\ninfections, we estimate the current total number of IBD patients eligible for BX003 at \\n~930,000 in the U.S. alone. \\nWe anticipate BiomX launches BX003 in 2025 at a price of $60,000, which is \\napproximately equivalent to the price of biologic therapeutics currently used to treat \\nCrohn’s and colitis, such as Remicade (Infliximab, ~$50,000/yr). These biologics \\ndemonstrate remission rates of 20-40% in IBD, so we see this price as justified if BX003 \\ncontinues its success in the clinic. Because of the highly targeted nature of the phage \\ncocktail and the unmet need for recurrent IBD, we model rapid adoption of BX003 with \\nmarket share approaching 0.7% at peak. Patent expiration is currently 2037 to 2038. It is \\nexpected BiomX pursues commercialization in the U.S. with its internal salesforce, though \\nwe note companies like Takeda have provided substantial terms ($50 million upfront; $640 \\nmillion in milestones) for rights to microbiome-based therapies (in this case, Enterome \\n(private) and EB8018). \\nCompanion diagnostic provides long-term upside. BiomX is developing a companion \\ndiagnostic with Boehringer Ingelheim (private), a large multinational pharmaceutical \\ncompany. The goal of the collaboration, which is still in early discovery stage, is to find \\nbiomarkers that would identify patients responding to Boehringer drugs. Boehringer is \\nutilizing BiomX’s experience in the microbiome space and its screening capacity separate \\nfrom its own diagnostic assay (described above, for the Phase 1b/2a trial). No terms have \\nbeen disclosed. \\nWe see this partnership as a strong validation of BiomX’s capabilities. Up to 50% of \\npatients lose response to 1L therapy in IBD, though patients tend to stick with a \\nmedication if they are long-term responders (Front Med (2020) 2(7):517). Boehringer is \\nbetting BiomX can identify patients that will respond to its therapies based on microbiome \\nsignatures which could capture and keep the 50% of patients that respond long-term. We \\nlook for continued updates as the partnership matures. \\n \\n \\nMichael Higgins 212.409.2074\\nBiomX Inc. (PHGE)\\nPage 42\\nMarket opportunity in PSC. PSC is significantly less prevalent than IBD despite the \\nmultitude of possible complications leading to its formation. The CDC and NEJM estimate \\nthe prevalence of PSC at ~16 in 100,000 in the U.S. (0.02%; ~54,000 people). Like our \\nIBD model, we anticipate BiomX targets patients with PSC secondary to UC/IBD (80% of \\nthe PSC population, ~43,000 people) and those with confirmed Klebsiella infections (38% \\nof the combined population). This gives us a prevalence of ~16,500 people that are \\neligible to receive BX003.  \\nWe anticipate BiomX launches BX003 in 2025 at a price of $60,000. Rapid adoption is \\nagain anticipated due to the targeted nature of the therapy, and the fact that hepatobiliary \\ncomplications are common in IBD patients and therefore GI physicians are likely to have \\nextensive references in the hepatology community for which to send patients. We \\ntherefore model market share at 1.0% by 2030, an increase over IBD considering the \\nunmet need in PSC.

BIOMX IN COLORECTAL CANCER, CYSTIC FIBROSIS, ATOPIC \\nDERMATITIS \\nBiomX has developed three additional programs in cystic fibrosis (CF), atopic dermatitis \\n(AD) and colorectal cancer (CRC). CRC is a legacy program from BiomX based on \\nhistorical data around the presence of bacteria in tumors and preclinical data from the \\ncompany (details below). CF and AD are newer programs developed through the \\ncompany’s proprietary BOLT (BacteriOphage Lead to Therapy) platform for screening and \\noptimizing phage cocktails. We do not include these indications in our price target due to \\ntheir early nature (CRC preclinical; CF and AD in Phase 2) and limited data, though we \\nappreciate the large patient populations and unmet need certainly provide significant \\nfuture opportunity. \\n \\nTreatment of CF and AD with phages \\nThe phage cocktails for treatment of CF (BX004) and AD (BX005) were developed using \\nthe BOLT platform (Exhibit 44). With the experience BiomX has gathered in developing \\nphage cocktails, combined with its in-house manufacturing capabilities, the company can \\nnow develop fully functional phage cocktails in under two years. Part of the validation \\nallows for personalized proof-of-concept trials in humans to be run simultaneously, \\nproviding notable early safety data to allow expansion to Phase 2 trials within two years, \\ncompared to the ~six average for standard small molecule and biologic therapies. \\nIn these trials, each patient will receive a personalized cocktail. Essentially, BiomX repeats \\nthe final two steps in Exhibit 44 (Cocktail Optimization and Manufacturing & Formulation) \\nfor each patient following isolation of the bacterial infection. This does not significantly \\nincrease trial time but does provide extremely personalized care, which should lead to \\nsignificant improvements in patient outcomes. We look for the first proof-of-concept in CF \\nin 4Q’21 and updates from the AD trial in 1H’22. \\nExhibit 44: BOLT platform \\n \\nSources: BiomX Corporate presentation, November 2020 \\nCF and AD are very large markets. The Cystic Fibrosis Foundation estimates greater \\nthan 30,000 patients in the U.S., most of whom are able to be diagnosed by age two due \\nto the genetic nature of the disease. New therapies such as Trikafta are significantly \\nincreasing patient lifespan but are not notably reducing the hallmark lung infections of CF \\n(Ann Am Thorac Soc (2020) 17(2):212–220). P. aeruginosa specifically is the most \\ncommon infection in CF and can drive the severity of disease throughout a patient’s life \\n(Pediatr Clin North Am (2016) 63(4):567-584). \\nMichael Higgins 212.409.2074\\nBiomX Inc. (PHGE)\\nPage 45\\nIncidence of AD, also referred to as atopic eczema, has increased 2- to 3-fold in \\nindustrialized nations since the 1970s, with ~10.7% of children and 7.2% of adults affected \\nin the United States; 90% of patients develop symptoms within the first five years of life. \\nAD is non-life threatening but significantly impacts quality of life, with >75% of patients \\nvisiting a doctor in the last year specifically for AD and >10% missing multiple days of \\nwork or school, at an estimated ~$5.4 billion total burden on the U.S. health system \\nindependent of actual treatment costs (J Am Acad Dermatol (2006) 55(3):490-500; J \\nInvest Dermatol (2015) 135(1):56-66; Am J Manag Care (2017) 23:-S0). \\nCF indication. The expansion to CF is derived from the presence of Pseudomonas \\naeruginosa in the lungs of patients. P. aeruginosa colonization is the most important \\ncontributor to morbidity and mortality in CF, a disease where 80% of patients succumb to \\nrespiratory failure due to inflammation and chronic bacterial infection (BMC Pulm Med \\n(2016) 16:174). Infections in CF are often treated by a standard suite of antibiotics that \\nultimately result in bacterial resistance. CF is a common disease in the world (1:100,000 \\nincidence), with significantly more Caucasian patients affected (1:2,500-4000) (Arch Dis \\nChild (2014) 99(11):1033-6). \\nThere is a precedence for treatment of CF pathogens with phages (J Evol Biol (2016) \\n29(1):188-98). Friman, et al showed that pre-adapting phages to bacterial strains led to \\nless resistance than using “ancestral”, or non-mutated, phage strains. The authors \\nconcluded that phage therapies for treatment of bacterial infections in CF likely require \\nadjustments for each individual patient. Through the BOLT platform, BiomX is able to \\ndevelop phage cocktails that could be tailored to the patient and bacterial strain(s). In vitro, \\nBX004 displays enhanced biofilm penetration compared to antibiotics (p<0.001; Exhibit \\n45), as measured by crystal violet biomass staining. \\nExhibit 45: BX004 penetrates P. aeruginosa biofilm \\n \\n \\nSources: BiomX March 2021 corporate presentation \\n \\nExhibit 46: CF (left) and AD (right) Phase 2 trials \\n \\nSources: BiomX Corporate presentation, November 2020 \\nMichael Higgins 212.409.2074\\nBiomX Inc. (PHGE)\\nPage 46\\nBiomX is currently running a Phase 2 trial in 20 CF patients with chronic P. aeruginosa \\ninfections (Exhibit 46). Each patient receives 10 days of nebulized treatment of a \\nspecialized cocktail optimized based on bacterial loads from patient sputum samples. \\nPrimary endpoints are safety and efficacy, with secondary endpoints including CF-specific \\nmetrics such as FEV1 and CFQ-R. BiomX anticipates topline data in 4Q’21. \\nAD indication. BiomX aims to treat AD through control of Staphylococcus aureus. \\nThough not a causative agent of AD, S. aureus is present early in the disease course and \\ndrives a problematic inflammatory immune response through release of its own virulence \\nfactors such as Protein A, the α-toxin, and the toxic-shock syndrome toxin-1 (TSST1) \\n(Postepy Dermatol Alergol (2019) 36(1):11–17). Between 30-100% of patients with AD \\nhave S. aureus infections with the prevalence increasing with disease severity (Trends \\nMicrobiol (2018) 26(6):484-497). There is significant evidence that the severity of disease \\nand size of AD lesions is directly proportional to the amount of S. aureus colonization, and \\nthat controlling this infection helps decrease disease severity and underlying immune-\\ndriven inflammation (Exhibit 47; Nat Rev Dis Primers (2018) 4(1)). \\nExhibit 47: Progression of disease in AD  \\n \\nSources: BiomX March 2021 corporate presentation \\n \\nExhibit 48: Progression of disease in AD  \\n \\nSource: BiomX March 2021 corporate presentation \\nIn preclinical studies, BX005 was shown to eradicate over 90% of strains from a panel of \\n120 S. aureus strains isolated from skin of subjects from the U.S. and E.U. (Exhibit 48). \\nThis data led BiomX directly to a Phase 2 trial, which is very similar to the CF trial (Exhibit \\n46). BiomX intends to recruit 80 patients to be treated for 8 weeks with a topical phage \\ncocktail tested against a patient’s skin swab, with a one-week observation period. The \\nprimary endpoints are safety and efficacy, with AD-specific secondary endpoints such as \\nEASI, IGA, and pruritis. The company expects data in 1H’22. \\nMichael Higgins 212.409.2074\\nBiomX Inc. (PHGE)\\nPage 47\\nTreatment of tumors with phages \\nRecent evidence indicates solid tumors contain bacterial species, and that these bacteria \\nmay interfere with the efficacy of specific chemotherapeutic agents. In one study, 76% of \\npancreatic ductal adenocarcinomas (PDACs) were positive for bacteria, specifically \\nGammaproteobacteria (Science (2017) 357(6356):1156–1160). Expression of a long \\nisoform of the bacterial enzyme cytidine deaminase (CDDL) conferred resistance to the \\nPDAC therapy gemcitabine in a mouse model, and cotreatment with the antibiotic \\nciprofloxacin significantly improved outcomes. In a screen of Chinese patients with \\ncolorectal cancer (CRC), researchers found Fusobacterium nucleatum was over-\\nrepresented in 87% of samples compared to normal controls (p<0.001), and that over-\\nrepresentation of F. nucleatum was significantly (p<0.005) associated with distant lymph \\nnode metastases (World J Gastroenterol (2016) 22(11):3227-33). BiomX was able to \\ncorroborate these results (Exhibit 49) and has begun a program to produce a phage \\ncocktail for treatment of F. nucleatum in CRC. \\nExhibit 49: F. nucleatum are significantly over-represented in CRC tissue samples \\n \\nSource: BiomX presentation, AACR Conference 2020 \\nCRC, when caught early, can be effectively treated with a combination of monitoring, \\nsurgery, and targeted therapies such as bevacizumab (marketed as Avastin). With the \\nadvent of immunotherapies, new targeted approaches are becoming available for adjuvant \\ntreatment of CRC, including nivolumab+ipilimumab (anti-PD-1+anti-CTLA-4), particularly \\nin patients with specific markers such as microsatellite instabilities (MSI-high). \\nUnfortunately, MSI-high patients represent a small portion of the patient populations \\n(~15%) which means many patients develop progressive, metastatic disease (Fam \\nCancer (2016) 15:405–412). \\nA major reason for the large number of progressive patients is the “cold” nature of many \\nlate-stage CRC tumors, meaning the level of T-cell infiltration is insufficient to induce an \\nimmune response against the tumor (Front Immunol (2019) 10:168). The possibility of \\nturning “cold” tumors “hot” is not necessarily a new concept, but there have been no \\nsignificant advances in the field and numerous blowups due to the lack of appropriate \\ntumor antigens, leading to a lack of T-cell activation and immune cell homing to the tumors \\n(Front Immunol (2019) 10:168). By using phage to lyse bacteria found in >80% of patient \\nsamples, BiomX hypothesizes that localized immune stimulation from bacterial PAMPs \\ncould turn the tumor “hot”, providing a platform for combinatorial use with multiple types of \\nimmunotherapy (Exhibit 50). \\nBiomX developed a novel CRC model by injecting mice subQ with CRC cells, then \\nadministering F. nucleatum IV after 12 days. CFU of bacteria per tumor were significantly \\n(p<0.001) greater compared to mice injected with PBS, indicating accumulation of F. \\nnucleatum within the tumors. BiomX then screened 11 DNA- and RNA-based phages \\nspecific to F. nucleatum in order to identify potential combinations for targeting CRC. \\nUltimately 2 lysogenic (temperate), dsRNA-based phages were identified and injected into \\nMichael Higgins 212.409.2074\\nBiomX Inc. (PHGE)\\nPage 48\\nthe mice models, with an average of 2x104 to 2x105 PFUs/mL found within the tumor less \\nthan 24hrs after IV administration, indicating localization to the tumor cells (Exhibit 51). \\nExhibit 50: Phage payload aims to induce immune-stimulation to enhance effectiveness of CPIs \\n \\nSources: BiomX presentation, AACR Conference 2020; BiomX presentation, CICON 2019 \\nExhibit 51: BiomX developed its own CRC model to recapitulate the effects of F. nucleatum infection \\n \\nSource: BiomX presentation, AACR Conference 2020; BiomX presentation, CICON 2019 \\nIn our view, the most important piece of data presented by BiomX for this program \\ninvolves the conversion of the F. nucleatum phage from lysogenic to a lytic form with an \\nadded genetic payload. Researchers commonly use lysogenic phages to deliver payloads \\nof useful gene products into bacteria (Adv Drug Deliv Rev (2016) 106(Pt A): 45–62). This \\nstrategy is particularly useful considering the vast characteristic differences between \\nphages, which allows researchers to structure phages as “tunable carriers” of genetic \\nmaterial. Lytic phages, due to their function of destroying bacteria, often carry “explosive” \\nMichael Higgins 212.409.2074\\nBiomX Inc. (PHGE)\\nPage 49\\npayloads such as restriction enzymes (Lett Appl Microbiol (2003) 37(4):318-23) or \\nantibiotics (Antimicrob Agents Chemother (2006) 50(6):2087-97) to destroy target bacteria \\nmore thoroughly. \\nIn the case of BiomX, the company has converted a lysogenic phage specific to F. \\nnucleatum to a lytic phage that carries immune-stimulating payloads including IL-15 and \\nGM-CSF (Exhibit 52). Because F. nucleatum is specific to CRC, phage are drawn to the \\ntumor and inject their genetic material for replication, including the code for the immune-\\nstimulating protein. Upon lysis of the bacteria, new phage is released plus the immune-\\nstimulating agent. Immune cells are thus drawn to the tumor, turning it from “cold” to “hot”, \\nmeaning the immune system recognizes the tumor as foreign and agents such as \\ncheckpoint inhibitors can subsequently eradicate the tumor (see Exhibit 50).  \\nExhibit 52: Key CRC milestones for BiomX \\n \\nSource: BiomX March 2021 corporate presentation  \\n \\nDevelopment plan and market potential. BiomX is currently undertaking pre-IND proof-\\nof-concept studies on the phage approach to treating CRC. Because of the synthetic \\nbiology approach to deploying these phages, the timelines for clinical development are \\nnotably increased compared to the other targeted illnesses in the BiomX pipeline. We \\nanticipate the company provides data on preliminary animal studies in 3Q’21. \\nThe lack of efficacy in turning “cold” tumors “hot” has not stopped large pharma from \\ninking significant deals with, or outright acquiring, smaller companies in an effort to be the \\nfirst to use combinatorial therapy to increase the number of potential patients reached by \\nimmune therapies (Exhibit 53). CRC is currently poorly treated with checkpoint inhibitors \\noutside of specific mutations, such as MSI-high and EGFR+ (Oncologist (2020) 25(1):33-\\n45), especially in later lines of therapy. CRC is the third most common cancer in the world, \\nwith 1.9 million new cases in 2020 and 935,000 deaths, according to the WHO, which \\nmakes it an extremely large potential market and therefore a rationalization for large \\npharma investment. We believe BiomX will pursue a licensing deal with a larger pharma \\npartner to combine an immune checkpoint inhibitor with the as-yet-unnamed CRC phage \\nasset in order to optimize the potential commercial reach of this therapy. Below we \\nhighlight some past deals for the most relevant comparator therapy, oncolytic viruses. To \\nnote, BiomX is currently trading below what some companies have received in upfront \\nmoney as part of licensing deals and is currently 2-3x below the average acquisition price \\nfor single-asset companies in this space. \\nMichael Higgins 212.409.2074\\nBiomX Inc.

Additionally, BiomX is \\nconsidered an “emerging growth company” and they cannot be certain if the reduced \\ndisclosure requirements applicable to “emerging growth companies” will make their \\ncommon stock less attractive to investors. \\nThe Israeli government grants the company has received for research and development \\nexpenditures restrict their  ability to manufacture products and transfer technology outside \\nof Israel and requires the company to satisfy specified conditions. If the company  fails  to \\nsatisfy these conditions, they  may be required to refund grants previously received, \\ntogether with interest and penalties. As a “smaller reporting company” the company is \\npermitted  to provide less disclosure than larger public companies, which may make their \\nCommon Stock less attractive to investors. \\nClinical development risk. BX001, BX003, plus any subsequent pipeline assets, must \\nundergo rigorous clinical development before submissions to regulatory agencies. Any of \\nBiomX’s current or future assets may not produce efficacy sufficient to warrant approval or \\nmay be deemed too toxic or produce too many adverse events to be commercially viable. \\nDespite best efforts of the company, clinical development timelines could be significantly \\ndelayed, possibly due in part to inability to recruit patients, which could impact the \\npotential for the asset, including commercial success. BiomX intends to market BX001 as \\na cosmetic which does not require significant regulatory oversight compared to other \\nbiologic assets, but there is still risk the product’s marketing plan will be rejected. The \\nproducts have not yet been tested in mid- or late-stage trials involving significantly more \\npatients, which could bring to light issues that could not be seen in smaller early trials. \\nDepending on the path of COVID-19, BiomX’s clinical development may also become \\nsignificantly delayed. Potential political, economic and military instability in the State of \\nIsrael, where the majority of  senior management and  research and development facilities \\nare located, may adversely affect  results of operations. \\nRegulatory risks. BiomX will seek to market its BX003 therapies and will therefore \\nrequire approval for regulatory bodies including the FDA in the U.S. and the EMA in the \\nE.U. Regulatory bodies require significant clinical and manufacturing data prior to approval \\nand there is no guarantee BiomX will be able to provide sufficient information requested \\nby the agencies. BX003 is a novel phage-derived therapy and may therefore be held to \\ndifferent standards than other previously-approved medications in the same disorders \\nsuch as inflammatory bowel diseases. Regulatory agencies may require BiomX conduct \\nadditional studies in order to verify the safety and efficacy of BX003 before approving a \\nfirst-of-its kind therapy; this would significantly delay commercialization and BiomX may \\nnot be capitalized sufficiently to fulfill these demands. In addition, the FDA or other \\nregulatory agencies may lack experience in evaluating the safety and efficacy of drugs \\nbased on these approaches, which could lengthen the regulatory review process, increase \\nthe combined company’s development costs, and delay or prevent commercialization of \\nthe combined company’s product candidates. \\nMichael Higgins 212.409.2074\\nBiomX Inc. (PHGE)\\nPage 54\\nPhage-related risks. BiomX will be seeking to develop therapies using bacteriophage \\ntechnology, a novel approach, which makes it difficult to predict the time and cost of \\ndevelopment. No bacteriophage products have been approved in the U.S. or elsewhere. \\nThe safety and efficacy of phage therapy in humans has not been extensively studied in \\nwell-controlled modern clinical trials. BiomX cannot be certain that this approach will lead \\nto the development of approvable or marketable drugs. Developing phage-based \\ntherapies on a commercial scale will also require developing new manufacturing \\nprocesses and techniques. BiomX may experience manufacturing delays or may not be \\nable to manufacture phages at the scale required to efficiently conduct the clinical trials \\nrequired to obtain regulatory approval of its product candidates, or to manufacture \\ncommercial quantities of their products, if approved. \\nIntellectual property risks. BiomX has licensed many patents from Keio University and \\nYeda Research and Development Co., Ltd., as well as established a partnership with JSR \\nCorporation. If BiomX does not fulfill its portion of the contracts, its partners may terminate \\nthe contracts which would significantly impact the future potential of its assets and \\npotentially other future pipeline assets. BiomX is also building its own patent pipeline but \\nthere is no guarantee these patents will ultimately be enforceable, or that similar patents \\nwill be approved or enforceable in all jurisdictions. The pharmaceutical industry is \\nnotoriously litigious and lawsuits are a common part of operating a pharmaceutical \\nbusiness. Should BiomX’s or its partners patents be challenged in court there is no \\nguarantee either party would be able to maintain its patent rights, which could materially \\nimpact the commerciality of the product and may severely impact future revenue potential. \\nCommercialization risks. BiomX has licensed BX001 to an international cosmetics \\ncompany for commercialization. There is no guarantee the partner company will prioritize \\nmarketing of BX001 or that the royalties owed to BiomX will result in significant net \\nrevenues, which is also applicable if BiomX licenses its other assets. BiomX intends to \\nself-commercialize BX003 but has not yet put together a salesforce or commercial \\ninfrastructure. There can be no guarantee that when this buildout occurs the efforts will be \\nsuccessful. BiomX may have difficulty selling clinicians and patients on the potential for a \\nnovel therapy and may have to spend significant sums educating the public on the \\nbenefits of its bacteriophage therapies, at potentially significant costs to itself. IBD \\nspecifically is an extremely large market with entrenched players, including large \\npharmaceutical companies with marketing and sales means significantly beyond what \\nBiomX may put together upon launch of its first product. Companies already in the space \\nlikely have reimbursement experience that aids their ability to receive placement on \\nformulary, which aids uptake and may significantly displace BiomX’s assets. Exchange \\nrate fluctuations between the U.S. Dollar, the New Israeli Shekel, the Euro and other \\nforeign currencies, may negatively affect  future revenues. \\nMichael Higgins 212.409.2074\\nBiomX Inc.

Furthermore, no part of my compensation was, is, or will be directly or indirectly related to the specific recommendation or views\\nexpressed in this research report, provided, however, that:\\nThe research analyst primarily responsible for the preparation of this research report has or will receive compensation based upon various\\nfactors, including the volume of trading at the firm in the subject security, as well as the firm’s total revenues, a portion of which is generated\\nby investment banking activities.\\nAdditional information regarding the contents of this publication will be furnished upon request. Please contact Ladenburg Thalmann,\\nCompliance Department, 640 Fifth Avenue, 4th floor, New York, New York 10019 (or call 212-409-2000) for any information regarding current\\ndisclosures, and where applicable, relevant price charts, in regard to companies that are the subject of this research report.\\nCOMPANY BACKGROUND\\nBiomX is a clinical-stage microbiome company developing both natural and engineered phage cocktails designed to target and destroy bacteria\\nthat affect the appearance of skin (BX001 in acne; Phase 2), as well as target bacteria in the treatment of chronic diseases, such as cystic\\nfibrosis (CF; BX004; Phase 2), atopic dermatitis (AD; BX005; Phase 2), inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and primary sclerosing cholangitis\\n(PSC) (BX003; combined in a Phase 1b/2a), and colorectal cancer (CRC, preclinical). BiomX discovers and validates proprietary bacterial\\ntargets and customizes phage compositions against these targets using its in-house BOLT platform.\\nVALUATION METHODOLOGY\\nWe are initiating coverage of BiomX Inc. with a Buy rating and $25.00 price target. Our PT is based on our risk-adjusted sum of the parts\\nanalysis, including Operating expenses of -$12.24/share, BX001 ($8.69), BX003 ($27.23) and cash/share of $1.38. BiomX holds no debt.\\nFactors that could negatively affect our estimates include clinical trial execution, unexpected competitive advances, diminished regulatory\\noutlook and greater than expected dilution.\\nRISKS\\nFinancing risks. BiomX has not generated any revenue to date and it cannot be assured that the company will ever be a revenue-generating\\ncompany. The company has incurred operating losses since its inception, anticipates incurring continued losses for the foreseeable future and\\nmay never achieve profitability. Additional capital is also expected to be required to fund clinical and preclinical research, commercialization and\\ncosts associated with being a public company. It cannot be assured BiomX will be able to obtain sufficient financing to maintain its operations,\\nor that any financing obtained will be at terms amenable to both the company and existing shareholders. Additionally, BiomX is considered an\\n“emerging growth company” and they cannot be certain if the reduced disclosure requirements applicable to “emerging growth companies”\\nwill make their common stock less attractive to investors.\\nClinical development risk.BX001, BX003, plus any subsequent pipeline assets, must undergo rigorous clinical development before\\nsubmissions to regulatory agencies. Any of BiomX’s current or future assets may not produce efficacy sufficient to warrant approval or may be\\ndeemed too toxic or produce too many adverse events to be commercially viable. Despite best efforts of the company, clinical development\\ntimelines could be significantly delayed, possibly due in part to inability to recruit patients, which could impact the potential for the asset, including\\ncommercial success. BiomX intends to market BX001 as a cosmetic which does not require significant regulatory oversight compared to other\\nbiologic assets, but there is still risk the product’s marketing plan will be rejected. The products have not yet been tested in mid- or late-stage\\ntrials involving significantly more patients, which could bring to light issues that could not be seen in smaller early trials. Depending on the path\\nof COVID-19, including a “second wave” of infections in key countries, BiomX’s clinical development may also become significantly delayed.\\nRegulatory risks. BiomX will seek to market its BX003 therapies and will therefore require approval for regulatory bodies including the\\nFDA in the U.S. and the EMA in the E.U. Regulatory bodies require significant clinical and manufacturing data prior to approval and there\\nis no guarantee BiomX will be able to provide sufficient information requested by the agencies. BX003 is a novel phage-derived therapy\\nand may therefore be held to different standards than other previously-approved medications in the same disorders such as inflammatory\\nbowel diseases. Regulatory agencies may require BiomX conduct additional studies in order to verify the safety and efficacy of BX003 before\\napproving a first-of-its kind therapy; this would significantly delay commercialization and BiomX may not be capitalized sufficiently to fulfill these\\ndemands. In addition, the FDA or other regulatory agencies may lack experience in evaluating the safety and efficacy of drugs based on these\\napproaches, which could lengthen the regulatory review process, increase the combined company’s development costs, and delay or prevent\\ncommercialization of the combined company’s product candidates.\\nPhage-related risks. BiomX will be seeking to develop therapies using bacteriophage technology, a novel approach, which makes it difficult to\\npredict the time and cost of development. No bacteriophage products have been approved in the U.S. or elsewhere. The safety and efficacy of\\nphage therapy in humans has not been extensively studied in well-controlled modern clinical trials. BiomX cannot be certain that this approach\\nMichael Higgins 212.409.2074\\nBiomX Inc. (PHGE)\\nPage 60\\nwill lead to the development of approvable or marketable drugs. Developing phage-based therapies on a commercial scale will also require\\ndeveloping new manufacturing processes and techniques. BiomX may experience manufacturing delays or may not be able to manufacture\\nphages at the scale required to efficiently conduct the clinical trials required to obtain regulatory approval of its product candidates, or to\\nmanufacture commercial quantities of their products, if approved.\\nIntellectual property risks. BiomX has licensed many patents from Keio University and Yeda Research and Development Co., Ltd., as well\\nas established a partnership with JSR Corporation. If BiomX does not fulfill its portion of the contracts, its partners may terminate the contracts\\nwhich would significantly impact the future potential of its assets and potentially other future pipeline assets. BiomX is also building its own\\npatent pipeline but there is no guarantee these patents will ultimately be enforceable, or that similar patents will be approved or enforceable in\\nall jurisdictions. The pharmaceutical industry is notoriously litigious and lawsuits are a common part of operating a pharmaceutical business.\\nShould BiomX’s or its partners patents be challenged in court there is no guarantee either party would be able to maintain its patent rights,\\nwhich could materially impact the commerciality of the product and may severely impact future revenue potential.\\nCommercialization risks. BiomX has licensed BX001 to an international cosmetics company for commercialization. There is no guarantee\\nthe partner company will prioritize marketing of BX001 or that the royalties owed to BiomX will result in significant net revenues, which is\\nalso applicable if BiomX licenses its other assets. BiomX intends to self-commercialize BX003 but has not yet put together a salesforce or\\ncommercial infrastructure. There can be no guarantee that when this buildout occurs the efforts will be successful. BiomX may have difficulty\\nselling clinicians and patients on the potential for a novel therapy and may have to spend significant sums educating the public on the benefits\\nof its bacteriophage therapies, at potentially significant costs to itself. IBD specifically is an extremely large market with entrenched players,\\nincluding large pharmaceutical companies with marketing and sales means significantly beyond what BiomX may put together upon launch of\\nits first product. Companies already in the space likely have reimbursement experience that aids their ability to receive placement on formulary,\\nwhich aids uptake and may significantly displace BiomX’s assets.\\nSTOCK RATING DEFINITIONS\\nBuy: The stock’s return is expected to exceed 12.5% over the next twelve months.\\nNeutral: The stock’s return is expected to be plus or minus 12.5% over the next twelve months.\\nSell: The stock’s return is expected to be negative 12.5% or more over the next twelve months.\\nInvestment Ratings are determined by the ranges described above at the time of initiation of coverage, a change in risk, or a change in target\\nprice. At other times, the expected returns may fall outside of these ranges because of price movement and/or volatility. Such interim deviations\\nfrom specified ranges will be permitted but will become subject to review.\\nRATINGS DISPERSION AND BANKING RELATIONSHIPS AS OF (April 15, 2021)\\nRating\\n%\\nIB %\\nBUY\\n77.8\\n60.6\\nNEUTRAL\\n21.6\\n47.4\\nSELL\\n0.6\\n0.0\\nCOMPANIES UNDER MICHAEL\\'S COVERAGE\\nAchieve Life Sciences, Inc.

Checkpoint inhibitors have ushered\\nin the promise of immunotherapy in oncology, as the combined sales of Keytruda and Opdivo exceeded\\n$19B in 2019. However, several inherent limitations, such as varying antigen expression, resistance to\\ntherapy, and insufficient immune response, ultimately result in significant unmet needs in multiple types\\nof cancer. In addition to the PD-1/L1 inhibitors, harnessing other cell types, which are also an integral\\npart of an immune system, should prove beneficial in the long run. Indeed, multiple new targets have\\nbeen identified with promising clinical data. Two companies we recommend to investors are NextCure\\n(NXTC) and Trillium (TRIL) for their unique and leading positions in the immuno-oncology space.\\n• Going after solid tumors by targeting Siglec-15. We initiate coverage of NextCure Inc. with a Market\\nOutperform rating and $55 price target, based on a discounted EPS and revenue multiple analysis.\\nPreliminary data, including a durable complete response (CR, patient on treatment for over 55 weeks)\\nand partial response (PR, patient on treatment for over 28 weeks) along with 14 stable diseases (SD) in\\nmultiple solid tumors, in particular NSCLC (where the CR and PR were achieved), were demonstrated\\nin a Phase 1 ‘all-comer’ monotherapy study. In addition, the promising signal was accompanied by a\\nwell-tolerated safety profile without DLT (dose-limiting toxicity) until the dose-escalation study reached\\na level as high as four times (1,600 mg) the RP2D (400 mg). Therefore, based on these initial results,\\nwe believe the Siglec-15 targeting monoclonal antibody, NC-318, has the potential to address multiple\\nbig indications, including NSCLC, endometrial cell cancer, ovarian cancer, squamous cell carcinoma,\\nMerkel cell cancer, and head and neck cancer. Considering NSCLC alone, we estimate NC-318 could\\ngenerate up to $2.1B in peak risk-adjusted revenues by the end of 2029.\\n• Activating macrophages with SIRPα decoys. We initiate coverage of Trillium Therapeutics with a\\nMarket Outperform rating and $10 price target, based on a discounted EPS and revenue multiple\\nanalysis. We believe the combination of a differentiated side-effect profile and early, yet compelling,\\nmonotherapy clinical data sets the stage to drive future value in targeting the macrophage-specific\\nimmune checkpoint CD47. In our view, TTI-621’s 18-29% ORR (objective response rate) achieved in a\\nPhase 1 study has the potential to beat a major competitor’s product, magrolimab (developed by Forty\\nSeven, FTSV, which was acquired by Gilead for $4.9B), as well as other CD47 monoclonal antibodies\\nin development. In addition, the company is also developing an IgG4-based decoy receptor, TTI-622,\\nwhich has shown some promising initial clinical activity by achieving a CR in a dose-escalating study.\\nBased on our model, we estimate Trillium could generate up to $1.2B in peak risk-adjusted revenue\\nby the end of 2029.\\nReni J.

However, unlike \\nradiotherapy and chemotherapy, I/O therapeutics do not attack cancer cells directly, but rather, unleash \\nthe immune system to attack cancer cells instead. It has been estimated that in 2019, at least 3,876 \\nactive I/O agents/combinations are in development worldwide, which represents a jump of more than \\n90% from merely two years ago (Figure 1).  \\n \\nFIGURE 1.  Active I/O Agents in the Current Global Drug Development Pipeline \\n   \\n \\n     Source: Xin Yu J et al., Nat Rev Drug Discov. 2019 \\n \\nThe first generation of antibody-based I/O, so-called checkpoint inhibitors (CPIs), work by blocking the \\nreceptor and/or ligand interactions of a few immune checkpoint molecules, such as PD-1, PD-L1 and \\nCTLA-4. PD-1/L1 are the second and third of the top 15 targets currently being developed (Xin Yu J et \\nal., Nat Rev Drug Discov. 2019), only surpassed by CD19 which is a B cell marker and remains a major \\ntarget for cell therapies (which we discussed in detail in another report, see note). However, while \\ntremendous success has been achieved by the anti-PD-1/L1 therapies, there are still many types of \\ncancer that do not respond to these treatments. Furthermore, for the approved indications, the response \\nrates are still limited in many tumor types. In addition, investors should be aware that the CPIs are not \\nwithout significant side effects. Since a major goal of I/O is to boost the immune system by interfering \\nwith the tumor immune microenvironment (TIME), we believe an understanding of the TIME is \\nnecessary, in order to understand the promise of such an approach to address hard-to-treat diseases \\nlike cancer. \\nTumor Immune Microenvironment (TIME) \\nThe tumor immune microenvironment is comprised of the surrounding blood vessels, immune cells, \\nfibroblasts, and extracellular matrix.  TIME is different from the more commonly used nomenclature of \\ntumor microenvironment (TME) which should include all of the aforementioned components.  Within the \\nTIME, the immune cells are in a battle with cancerous cells. Eventually, both tumor-promoting and \\nsuppressing immune cells or cytokines/chemokines build up around the tumor mass and TIME (Figure \\n2), where the I/O therapies aim to shift the balance in favor of tumor suppression or clearance.  \\n \\n \\n \\nBiotechnology\\nMay 26, 2020\\n3\\nFIGURE 2.  Cellular Components of the TIME \\n                                         \\n \\n     Source: Curigliano G, Curr Opin Oncol. 2014 \\n \\nCategorization of the TIME \\nIn general, TIME can be distinguished by three major categories: \\n1) Infiltrated–excluded (I–E) TIME (Figure 3A). These TIMEs are broadly populated with immune cells \\nbut are relatively short on cytotoxic lymphocytes (CTLs) in the core of the tumor, and therefore are \\nconsidered as a ‘cold’ environment where the tumor cells have effectively shielded itself from activating \\nthe immune system. Importantly, I–E TIMEs are often found in various epithelial cancers such as \\ncolorectal carcinoma (CRC) and pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC), in which the tumor-\\nassociated macrophages (TAMs) along the tumor margins have been hypothesized to prevent CTL \\ninfiltration into the tumor core (Beatty GL et al., Gastroenterology. 2015). \\n2) Infiltrated–inflamed (I–I) TIMEs (Figure 3B) are considered to be immunologically ‘hot’ tumors and \\nare characterized by a high infiltration of CTLs expressing immune checkpoint receptor PD-1, and \\nleukocytes and tumor cells expressing the PD-1 ligand PD-L1. Therefore, tumors with this type of TIME \\nare supposed to be more susceptible to the treatment of PD-1/L1 inhibitors. Notably, I-I TIMEs are often \\nassociated with tumors of high mutation rates and neoantigens (antigens that are only found in the \\ntumor cells). For example, CRC with high levels of microsatellite instability (MSI-H) is correlated with \\nhigher rates of nonsynonymous single-nucleotide polymorphisms, thus leading to increased numbers of \\nneoantigens and of tumor-infiltrating PD-1+ CTLs, which have significantly higher responses to CPIs \\nthan do microsatellite instability low (MSI-L) or microsatellite stable (MSS) CRCs. \\n3) Infiltrated- tertiary lymphoid structures (I-TLS) (Figure 3C) are actually a subset of I-I TIMEs \\nwhich contains tertiary lymphoid structures (TLS), tissue aggregates that resemble lymph nodes. TLSs \\ncan contain a diversity of lymphocytes, including naive and activated T cells, regulatory T (Treg) cells, B \\ncells and dendritic cells (DCs). TLSs are generally present at the invasive tumor margin and in the \\nstroma, and are thought to act as sites of lymphoid recruitment and immune activation that are typically \\nformed in settings of enhanced inflammation, such as after administration of an autologous tumor \\nvaccine. Clinically, I-TLS is often associated with relatively better prognosis because it can provide both \\nactivated and naïve T or B cells for anti-tumor purposes. \\n \\n \\n \\nBiotechnology\\nMay 26, 2020\\n4\\nFIGURE 3.  Three Major Types of TIME \\n    \\n    \\n     Source: Binnewies M et al., Nat Med. 2018 \\nTIME connection to cancer  \\nEvidently, TIME is an integral part of tumor life, and it plays a significant role in providing an \\nimmunosuppressive environment for malignant transformation. It is believed to be shaped, or at least \\nmolded by the tumor itself during primary tumor formation, and further modified during metastasis \\nthrough direct or indirect interactions between the tumor and the immune system. One is TIME being \\nimpacted by the cytokines or chemokines secreted by the tumor. The other is TIME’s impact on the \\ntumor transformation via the cytokines the immune cells secret, both pro- or anti-tumor. These \\ninteractions provide a rationale for developing therapeutic agonists or antagonists, in order to disrupt \\nthese interactions between the tumor and its TIME. That said, it is not a straightforward task, because \\nmany of these cytokines/chemokines/receptors can be both pro- and anti-tumor, depending on the \\ncontext, leading to undesirable side effects.  \\nOn the other hand, the formation and integrity of the tumor microenvironment also depends on direct \\ncell-cell interaction between the TIME and tumor. More importantly, several immune checkpoint \\nmechanisms such as the PD-1/L1 and the CTLA-4 pathways have been proven to be effective anti-\\ntumor drug targets. In our opinion, additional novel targets are emerging as our understanding of the \\nTIME-tumor interactions in different stages of cancer development continue to advance.  \\n1) \\nThe shaping of TIME by the tumor during primary tumor formation. Tumors are known to have \\nthe ability to establish a pro-tumoral and immunosuppressive environment to support their growth \\nand promote immune evasion through secreting a variety of cytokines or chemokines. For instance, \\nin melanoma, the disease-causing BRAFV600E mutation has been shown to induce constitutive \\nWNT/β -catenin signaling, which in turn decreases production of CCL4, a chemokine important for \\nthe recruitment of dendritic cells (DCs) for adaptive immune activation. Additionally, BRAFV600E \\nhas been shown to induce expression of cytokines such as IL-10 and IL-1α, which can induce \\nimmune-tolerant forms of DC and cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs), respectively. \\n \\n \\nBiotechnology\\nMay 26, 2020\\n5\\nIn another example, the oncogenic KRASG12D mutation in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma \\n(PDAC) leads to the secretion of GMCSF, which is associated with the development of \\nimmunosuppressive CD11b+ myeloid cells. Moreover, deficiency in the tumor suppressor p53 in \\nhepatic stellate cells can result in the production of factors that convert the macrophages in TIME \\nfrom the anti-tumor M1 to the pro-tumor M2 phenotype (Figure 4). Understandably, a lot of these \\nregulations are carried out through paracrine cytokines. However, due to the complex and multi-\\nfunctional nature of the involved cytokines or chemokines, any therapeutic interference needs to be \\ncarefully controlled and targeted to the right sites.  \\n \\nFIGURE 4.  TIME Shaping During Primary Tumor Formation \\n                                \\n \\n     Source: : Binnewies M et al., Nat Med. 2018 \\n \\nInterestingly, direct cell-cell interaction is another key mechanism for TIME-tumor interaction that \\nhas become an important therapeutic target now (Figure 5). Specifically, a large portion of the \\nactivated T cells in TIME are counteracted by checkpoints (e.g., interaction between PD-1 in the T \\ncells and PD-L1 in tumor or antigen presenting cells, APCs). These T cells are generally \\ncharacterized by high surface expression of inhibitory receptors such as the well-characterized \\nCTLA-4 (constitutively expressed, particularly on regulatory T cells) and PD-1 (typically found on \\nCD8+ T-cells), and others including TIM-3 and LAG-3, etc. Additionally, loss of effector functions, \\nprimarily through the decreased production of cytokines IFNγ, IL-2 and TNFα and loss of \\nproliferative capacity can occur during the exhaustion process. For therapeutic purposes, the \\nreversibility of the T cell exhaustion phenotype is critical. For example, cells can be rejuvenated to \\nattack tumors upon CPI treatment with or without additional ‘chargers’, while the irreversibly \\nexhausted cells are typically not responsive to such a therapy. \\n \\n \\nBiotechnology\\nMay 26, 2020\\n6\\n \\nFIGURE 5.  Change of TIME during Malignant Transformation  \\n                                          \\n    \\n     Source: Binnewies M et al., Nat Med. 2018 \\n \\n2) \\nThe role of TIME in metastasis. In addition to primary tumor formation, the tumor-induced TIME \\nhas the potential to impact tumor progression to metastatic disease. A TIME can predispose a tumor \\nfor successful seeding of a metastatic site. For example, several tumor associated macrophages \\n(TAMs) have been found to be immunosuppressive and increase in numbers with metastasis in the \\nTIME, while that of CD103+ DCs (which are important for response to CPIs, Salmon H et al., \\nImmunity. 2016) and the ratio of effective T cells to exhaustive T cells decrease. During metastatic \\nseeding, tumor cells that arrive early tend to die, and their debris is taken up by distinct waves of \\nmyeloid cells, with monocytes and macrophages being the dominant phagocytes in the pre-\\nmetastatic site. DCs have been shown to uptake minimal tumor debris/antigen, and this process is \\nthought to at least partially contribute to reduced anti-tumor T cell priming. Whereas populations \\nsuch as neutrophils have been associated with both metastatic success and failure, intriguingly, \\nmacrophages (the M2 subtype) are often ascribed as pro-metastatic, because their absence leads to \\npronounced metastatic failure (Figure 6).  \\n \\nFIGURE 6.  Change of TIME During Metastasis \\n                                     \\n    \\n     Source: Binnewies M et al., Nat Med. 2018 \\n \\n \\n \\nBiotechnology\\nMay 26, 2020\\n7\\nCurrent targets for immunotherapy (I/O) \\nAs the understanding of the complex relationships between cancer development and the immune \\nsystem, particularly the TIME were elucidated, I/O emerged as a viable and, sometimes, highly effective \\nstrategy for treating cancer. Varying response rates between indications and therapeutic strategies \\nhave highlighted the challenges, however. Although certain components of the immune system can be \\nreactivated and recruited to attack patients’ tumors, the same selective pressures and escape \\nmechanisms remain, potentially leading to the development of drug resistance. Despite this difficulty, \\nthe fact that I/O can lead to partial or even complete, and importantly, durable responses have spurred \\nmore and more companies into this field. While CPIs still dominate the field, other new targets are also \\nemerging rapidly. \\nThe checkpoint molecules are located on the surface of T cells, other types of immune cells, or tumor \\ncells as a switch for inhibiting T cell activation. Under physiological conditions, the immune checkpoint \\nmechanism provides a negative feedback mechanism to maintain self-tolerance, prevent autoimmune \\nresponses, and control the duration and extent of an immune response. However, this mechanism is \\noften hijacked by cancer cells to provide an immunosuppressive environment which then promotes its \\nown survival, growth and metastasis. It has now been demonstrated that this inhibitory mechanism can \\nbe released by monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) that inhibit checkpoints so that T cells can be activated, \\nor re-activated, against cancer cells (Figure 7). To date, multiple mAbs targeting cytotoxic T-\\nlymphocyte-associated protein 4 (CTLA-4), programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1) and its ligand (PD-\\nL1) have been approved in oncology (Figure 8). We will begin with a discussion of these three approved \\ntargets, followed by other new targets. \\nFIGURE 7.  T Cell Activation versus Exhaustion \\n   \\n \\n     Source: Havel JJ et al., Nat Rev Cancer. 2019 \\n \\n \\n \\nBiotechnology\\nMay 26, 2020\\n8\\nFIGURE 8.  Approved CPIs in the U.S. \\n    \\n     Source: FDA drug labels, JMP Securities LLC \\n \\nPD-1/PD-L1 \\nPD-1 is a receptor expressed on mature T cells in peripheral tissues and the TIME, as well as on non-\\nT cell immune cells such as B cells, DCs, and NK cells. On the other hand, PD-L1 is often found on \\nthe surface of tumor cells, DCs and macrophages in TIME. When PD-1 on T cells interact with its \\nligand PD-L1 (B7-H1/CD274) and PD-L2 (B7-DC/CD273), it leads to an immunosuppressive \\nresponse such as decreased production of inflammatory cytokines and cell survival proteins in the T \\ncells. Additionally, PD-L1 is able to interact with CD80 to provide a secondary mechanism of T cell \\nsuppression. In this instance, CD80 acts as the receptor and provides additional inhibitory signals. \\nClinically, this interaction has become one of the most successful targets in the current I/O therapies. \\nIn fact, all the approved CPIs except for one bind to either PD-1/ PD-L1 (Figure 8), and they have \\nachieved approximately 20-40% of overall response rates (ORR) in melanoma, 20-60% in NSCLC, \\n~20% in SCLC, 40-70% in lymphoma, 20-50% in urothelial carcinoma, ~20% in hepatocellular \\ncarcinoma, 30-50% in high microsatellite instability (MSI-H) tumors, and over 50% in Merkel cell or \\nrenal cell carcinomas (Figures 9-11). Solid commercial success has also been attained with the \\nclinical achievements, as Keytruda alone has generated over $11B and Opdivo generated another \\n$8B in sales worldwide in 2019.  \\nCTLA-4 \\nCTLA-4 is a transmembrane glycoprotein that is a homolog to the T cell co-stimulator CD28, which \\nprovides the second T cell activation signal following the TCR interaction by binding to CD80 (B7-1) \\nand CD86 (B7-2) on APCs. However, CTLA-4 has ~20 times the binding affinity for CD80/86 and, \\nconsequently, can outcompete CD28. Notably, regulatory T cells express CTLA-4 at even higher \\nlevels than do other T cells and allow these cells to maximize their immune-suppressive function. \\nBlocking CTLA-4 activates the immune system and causes severe reactions, including hepatitis, \\ncolitis and thyroiditis, which can explain the adverse side effects caused by Yervoy (ipilimumab), the \\nonly approved CTLA-4 inhibitor. Moreover, unlike other therapies that directly attack cancer cells to \\nreduce tumor size, Yervoy's efficacy could take several months to show. Due to these two limitations, \\nthe drug is currently only used in the treatment of melanoma as a monotherapy (Figure 11). \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\nTrade name\\nGeneric name\\nManufacturer\\nTarget\\nExpression sites\\nApproved tumor types\\nKeytruda\\nPembrolizumab\\nMerck\\nMelanoma, NSCLC, SCLC, HNSCC, cHL, PMBCL, urothelial \\ncarcinoma, microsatellite instability-high cancer, gastric cancer, \\nesophageal cancer,  cervical cancer, HCC, MCC, RCC and \\nendometrial carcinoma\\nOpdivo\\nNivolumab\\nBMS\\nMelanoma, NSCLC, SCLC, RCC, cHL, HNSCC, urothelial carcinoma, \\nmicrosatellite instability-high or mismatch repair deficient\\nmetastatic colorectal cancer, and HCC\\nLibtayo\\nCemiplimab\\nSanofi and \\nRegeneron\\nCutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (CSCC)\\nBavencio\\nAvelumab\\nMerck\\nMCC and urothelial carcinoma.\\nImfinzi\\nDurvalumab\\n AstraZeneca\\nNSCLC and urothelial carcinoma.\\nTecentriq\\nAtezolizumab\\nRoche\\nNSCLC, SCLC, urothelial carcinoma and TNBC \\nYervoy\\nIpilimumab\\nBMS\\nCTLA-4\\nT cells and NK \\ncells\\nMelanoma, RCC (+Opdivo), microsatellite instability-high or \\nmismatch repair deficient\\nmetastatic colorectal cancer (+Opdivo)\\nPD-1\\nT cell, B cell, NK \\ncell, monocytes, \\nand DCs\\nPD-L1\\nTumor cells, DCs, \\nand \\nmacrophages \\nBiotechnology\\nMay 26, 2020\\n9\\nFIGURE 9.

It is expressed on \\nactivated T cells, regulatory T (Treg) cells, B cells, and DCs. LAG-3 inhibits CD8+ effector T cells and \\nincreases the immuno-suppressive properties of Treg cells. Additionally, LAG-3 and PD-1 tend to be co-\\nexpressed on exhausted T cells and anti-LAG-3 mAbs have been shown to revive these cells (Woo SR \\net al., Cancer Res. 2012). Although LAG-3 knockout mice experience autoimmune symptoms, they \\nappear to be less severe than what was seen in CTLA-4 and PD-1 knockout mice, suggesting that LAG-\\n3 is less vital for regulating T cell function (Nirschl CJ et al., Clin Cancer Res. 2013). Therefore, these \\nresults support testing LAG-3 in the clinic as a novel immune checkpoint target.  \\nInitial clinical data for LAG-3 targeting drugs have been modest (Figure 14). While a Phase I dose-\\nescalation trial of eftilagimod alpha (Efti), Immutep’s (IMMP, NC) recombinant soluble LAG-3 fusion \\nprotein in RCC showed some responses at higher doses, the effect was not strong enough to justify \\npursuing monotherapy treatment. Combinations with chemotherapy produced better results, with two \\nPhase 1 trials (n=45 in total) of Efti plus paclitaxel achieving 47% ORR in HER2-/ HR+ metastatic breast \\ncancer (compared to 22-33% for historical control of paclitaxel alone). In addition, a combination \\ntherapy with Keytruda also showed some promising signs, with 41% ORR (n=17) in a Phase 1 study in \\nNSCLC patients regardless of PD-L1 levels. Typically, an ORR of 20-40% is associated with Keytruda \\nalone depending on the PD-L1 levels.  \\nIn a Phase I trial, Bristol-Myers Squibb’s anti-LAG-3 mAb, BMS-986016, plus Opdivo showed increased \\nactivity in melanoma patients with ≥1% LAG-3 expression (20% ORR) versus those with <1% LAG-3 \\nexpression (7%), indicating potential therapeutic benefits for high LAG-3 expressing patients. Now the \\ndrug is being evaluated in combination with Opdivo in patients with metastatic melanoma naïve to prior \\nimmunotherapy in an investigator’s sponsored study.  \\n \\nFIGURE 14.

Like LAG-3, it is associated with T cell exhaustion and can induce T cell \\nfunction dampening and apoptosis (Figure 15). The four natural TIM-3 ligands are galectin-9, HMGB1, \\nphosphatidylserine, and CEACAM-1. The cytoplasmic protein Bat3 acts as an adapter protein, \\nmodulating cell proliferation by binding TIM-3. When galectin-9, or any of the natural ligands bind to \\nTIM-3, Bat3 dissociates from TIM-3 and IFN-γ production decreases, leading to lower T cell proliferation \\n(Rangachari M et al., Nat Med. 2012). \\nDespite the promising mechanism of action, initial clinical data for TIM-3-targeting drugs has been \\nmixed (Figure 16). Novartis’ anti-TIM-3 mAb MBG453 achieved an ORR of 41.2% and a CR of 17.6% in \\na Phase Ib trial in a previously untreated AML cohort, underperforming Venclexta (CRi of 66%). In \\nanother study, GlaxoSmithKline’s anti-TIM-3 mAb TSR-022 has shown better results in the Phase I \\nAMBER trial, where three patients achieved PRs and eight achieved SDs out of 20 evaluable PD-1 \\nrefractory NSCLC patients when treated with 300 mg TSR-022 in combination with TSR-042 (an anti-\\nPD-1 mAb). Now, it is being evaluated in a dose-escalation study. \\nFIGURE 15.

It competes with the activating receptor \\nCD226 (DNAM-1), paralleling the CTLA-4 and CD28 interaction. The two primary co-ligands shared by \\nTIGIT and CD226 are CD155 (PVR) and CD112 (PVRL2), while CD113 (PVRL3) is a ligand for TIGIT \\nbut not CD226 (Figure 17). Preclinical studies have indicated that blocking TIGIT has anti-tumor activity \\nwithout the autoimmune responses characteristic of other checkpoints (Johnston RJ et al., Cancer Cell. \\n2014). Clinically, Merck’s MK-7684 has shown only 3% ORR (n=34) as a monotherapy in NSCLC, and \\n19% ORR (n=43) in combination with Keytruda. However, despite the lack of published data, Roche has \\ninitiated two Phase 3 trials recently for its anti-TIGIT antibody tiragolumab together with Tecentriq \\nand/or chemotherapy in the setting of first-line NSCLC (tiragolumab + Tecentriq) or first-line SCLC \\n(tiragolumab + Tecentriq + chemotherapy). In addition, a Phase 2 study is also ongoing for advanced \\ncervical cancer with tiragolumab and Tecentriq (Figure 19).  Notably, while Keytruda failed to gain FDA \\napproval, Tecentriq (+ chemotherapy) has been approved with 60% ORR and 5.2 months of mPFS and \\n12.3 months of mOS in first-line SCLC. The current addition of tiragolumab into the investigational \\nregimen highlights the big pharma’s confidence on the asset. Additionally, several early programs \\nincluding Compugen’s COM902, Arcus’ AB122 and Iteos’ E0S884448 are also in development against \\nthe same target (Figure 18).  \\nFIGURE 17.

Summary of the Roche Trials with Tiragolumab \\n   \\n \\n     Source: Roche presentation \\n \\nKIRs \\nKiller immunoglobulin-like receptors (KIRs) are a group of transmembrane glycoproteins found on NK \\ncells, tumor-associated cytotoxic T cells, and APCs. They have been shown to regulate the killing of NK \\nand T cells by interacting with the MHC class I molecules (Orr MT et al., Cell. 2010). KIRs play a key \\nrole in differentiating between healthy and non-healthy cells and can distinguish between MHC class I \\nallelic variants. Based on these mechanisms, a series of clinical studies have been initiated to test \\nwhether the KIRs can be targeted for anti-tumor purposes (Figure 20). Innate Pharma’s anti-KIR3DL2 \\nmonoclonal antibody IPH4102 has completed its Phase 1 study with 44 patients of relapsed/refractory \\ncutaneous T-cell lymphomas (CTCL) as a monotherapy. An ORR of 36% has been recorded, and the \\nalmost all (15 out of 16) of the responders were Sézary syndrome patients (representing an ORR of \\n43%). A new Phase 2 (TELLOMAK) study further evaluating IPH4102 alone or in combination with \\nchemotherapy in patients with advanced T cell lymphoma is currently underway. Innate Pharma’s other \\nKIR asset lirilumab (IPH2102/BMS-986015) has been licensed to BMY that targets KIR2DL1/2L3. In our \\nview, lirilumab does not seem to be as promising due to the lack of additive efficacy to Opdivo, and the \\nclinical programs have been largely discontinued or on hold.  \\nFIGURE 20.

Research has pointed \\nout that the PD-1/L1 pathway is only responsible for tumor immune evasion in fewer than 40% of \\nhuman solid tumors (Zhang Y et al., JAMA Oncol. 2016). In addition to the upregulation of PD-L1, many \\nother molecular or cellular mechanisms can also contribute to dysfunctional immunity in the TIME, \\nincluding a lack of sufficient immune cell infiltration, accumulation of regulatory T cells, the presence of \\ntumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) and myeloid-derived suppressive cells. Many of these \\nmechanisms, however, may not be suitable for therapeutic interference due to broad activation of the \\nimmune system with the risk of autoimmune toxicities. With this as background, the academic group led \\nby NextCure’s scientific founder Dr. Lieping Chen did a high-throughput screening of the human \\ntransmembrane proteome for the discovery of T cell activity modulators, and found Siglec-15 as an \\nimmune suppressive molecule largely operating in the TIME and it is non-redundant to the PD-1/L1 \\npathway (Wang J et al., Nat Med. 2019). Importantly, the expression of Siglec-15 is normally limited to \\ncells in myeloid lineage and is upregulated in cancer cells, rendering it a potentially suitable target for \\ncancer therapies. To date, NextCure is the only company developing Siglec-15 mAbs as cancer \\ntreatment. It has shown some durable activity including a CR, a PR and 14 SD responses during its \\nPhase 1 dose-escalation study. Importantly, no DLT was observed until the dose escalated to as high \\nas four times the currently chosen RP2D.  \\nCD47/ SIRPα \\nIn addition to the adaptive immune system and T cells, the innate immune system including the \\nphagocytic macrophages can also be manipulated for anti-tumor purposes. In addition, a similar \\nmechanism to the PD-1/PD-L1 immune checkpoint inhibition also exists between macrophages and \\ntheir target cells, which is often hijacked by cancer cells to trigger a ‘don’t eat me’ signal in the \\nmacrophages (Figure 21). The two key molecules that interact with each other here are CD47 and its \\nreceptor SIRPα. CD47 is expressed by healthy cells and often upregulated by cancer cells, while SIRPα \\nis expressed by macrophages. In particular, CD47 has been shown to be overexpressed in multiple \\nhematologic and solid tumor malignancies and appears to be a universal signal by which cancer cells \\nevade the attack from macrophages. However, CD47 is also widely expressed by red blood cells, and \\nSIRPα is expressed by neurons. Therefore, different strategies have been deployed to develop \\ntherapeutics that may render different efficacy and safety profiles (Figure 22). For example, a \\nmonoclonal antibody or a biologic with an intact FC region is able to trigger a strong target cell killing \\neffect through antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) or antibody-dependent cellular \\nphagocytosis (ADCP), with the potential to attack normal cells with the same antigen as well. On the \\nother hand, a biologic without an intact FC region can still prevent the CD47- SIRPα interaction, but may \\nresult in a less potent anti-tumor activity and the ‘antigen sink’ phenomenon.   \\n \\n \\n \\nBiotechnology\\nMay 26, 2020\\n18\\nFIGURE 21. Mechanism of Action of CD47 Blocking Antibodies \\n                              \\n \\n     Source: Chao MP et al., Front Oncol. 2020 \\n \\nDespite robust pre-clinical, anti-leukemic effects as monotherapy, clinical studies to date have not \\nshown the same degree of efficacy in patients, which has led to the discontinuation of Celgene/BMS’ \\nanti-CD47 mAb drug CC-90002 in the Phase 1 stage, and the rapid valuation drops of several other \\nrelevant companies. However, given that CD47 is an anti-phagocytic signal, strategies to increase \\npro-phagocytic signals on cancer cells can, in theory, synergize with CD47 blockade. This synergy \\ncan occur through simultaneous blockade of the negative (anti-phagocytic) CD47 signal while \\nenhancing the positive (pro-phagocytic) signal, leading to increased phagocytosis (Figure 23). For \\nexample, it has been demonstrated that certain chemotherapies and cytotoxic agents that cause \\ntumor cell damage can induce pro-phagocytic signals on cancer cells. In addition, the excitement \\nsurrounding anti-CD47 therapies has been re-ignited by Forty Seven’s data presented in ASH last \\nyear. To date, Trillium’s SIRPα decoy receptor TTI-621 has achieved 18-29% ORR as a monoagent \\nin various hematologic malignancies without the anemia side effect associated with anti-CD47 mAbs.     \\n \\n \\n \\nBiotechnology\\nMay 26, 2020\\n19\\nFIGURE 22.

We recommend shares \\nbased on preliminary data generated from the company’s proprietary Siglec-15-targeting monoclonal \\nantibody asset, NC-318, and the company’s novel I/O target discovery platform FIND-IO. We believe \\nthe company is one of a few players that can potentially stand out in the post-PD1/L1 era with a \\npromising novel target and a sustainable discovery engine. With NC-318 advancing in a Phase 2 study \\nand NC-410 entering a Phase 1 trial by 2021, and a strong cash position at $322MM, we believe \\nNextCure represents a unique investment opportunity, whose shares are attractively priced with ~70% \\npotential downside (bear case is $9) and ~155% potential upside (bull case is $85). \\nKey takeaways: \\n• \\nDurable responses achieved in an all-comer Phase 1 study bode well for NC-318. Notably, 49 \\npatients of 15 different tumor types have been treated with NC-318 as a monotherapy in the \\ncompleted Phase 1 study, regardless of PD-L1 or Siglec-15 expression. Impressively, a confirmed \\ncomplete response (CR) was already achieved in a NSCLC patient, who has been on treatment for \\nover 55 weeks (last update at SITC 2019).  In addition, a partial response (PR) was achieved in \\nanother NSCLC patient who has been treated for over 28 weeks (last update at SITC 2019). These \\ntwo objective responses were accompanied by 14 stable diseases (SD) with the longest treatment, \\nat the time, of over 16 weeks. We believe these early responses, especially the 15% objective \\nresponse rate (ORR) in the 13 NSCLC patients bode well for the Phase 2 study where NSCLC \\npatients with elevated Siglec-15 levels will be evaluated. \\n• \\nSuperior safety profile lays the foundation for combination options. As PD-1/L1 inhibitors get \\ninto the frontline of multiple cancer treatment paradigms, we believe the combination with a PD-\\n1/L1 inhibitor or chemotherapy is key for the successful commercialization of a novel I/O agent like \\nNC-318. Therefore, we believe the current safety profile of NC-318 with no dose-limiting toxicity \\n(DLT) through the 800 mg dose is definitely a good sign and leaves a lot of flexibility for future \\nstudies.  \\n• \\nAn efficient discovery engine to generate novel targets. Notably, the original high-throughput \\nscreening platform (from Dr. Lieping Chen’s laboratory at Yale that also discovered PD-L1) which \\nresulted in the discovery of Siglec-15 as a novel immune checkpoint target has been optimized and \\nis now an integral part of the company (the FIND-IO platform). It is capable of screening different \\ncDNA libraries (e.g., membrane proteins, soluble proteins, cytokines, etc.) in multiple types of \\nimmune or tumor cells to evaluate different functional readouts (e.g., T cell activation, cytokine \\nrelease, or cell death, etc.). We believe this discovery engine represents the strength of the \\ncompany’s R&D capabilities and can generate more assets (potentially a new IND every year) or \\ncollaboration revenues in the future. \\n \\n \\nBiotechnology\\nMay 26, 2020\\n21\\nINVESTMENT THESIS \\nNextCure is a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company committed to discovering and developing first-\\nin-class I/O agents to treat cancer by restoring normal immune function. The company adopts a \\nsystematic view to the immune system and focuses on understanding biological pathways, the \\ninteractions of cells and the role each interaction plays in an immune response to tumorigenesis. \\nThrough the proprietary FIND-IO discovery engine, the company has generated multiple novel targets \\nfor drug development including the wholly-owned lead asset NC-318, an anti-Siglec-15 monoclonal \\nantibody.  In addition, the company is focused on patients who do not respond to current therapies, \\npatients whose cancer progresses despite treatment, and patients with cancer types not adequately \\naddressed by available therapies, which we believe represent the most important opportunities in the \\nimmune checkpoint therapeutic space in the post-PD1/L1 era.  \\nCurrently, the company has two assets in the clinical stage. NC-318 is a monoclonal antibody targeting \\nthe novel immune checkpoint molecule Siglec-15 which is overexpressed in many tumor cells and M2 \\n(pro-tumoral) macrophages. It has completed a Phase 1 dosing study and is on track to enter a Phase 2 \\nstudy in mid-2020. NC-410 is a decoy receptor mimicking LAIR-2 to compete with the immune inhibitory \\nLAIR-1 in the tumor microenvironment. The IND for this asset has been cleared by the FDA, and the \\ncompany plans to start the Phase 1 study in patients with advanced or metastatic solid tumors in 2021. \\nBased on our analysis, the company has the potential the generate ~$2.0B in revenues from NC-318 in \\nNSCLC alone by YE29 in our base scenario. \\n \\nWhile we believe the company’s technology platform justifies a higher valuation than where the \\ncompany currently trades today, we suggest investors pay close attention to the clinical-stage product \\ncandidates, especially the following key assets, which are wholly-owned by the company, with \\ncommercialization opportunities within the next three to five years. \\n• \\nThe company’s lead product candidate, NC-318, was discovered in the company’s scientific \\nfounder’s (Dr. Lieping Chen) laboratory at Yale. Due to the non-overlapping expression profile of \\nSiglec-15 with PD-L1, the company believes its anti-Siglec-15 approach is most suitable for \\naddressing the patient populations who do not respond to PD-1/L1 therapies, which represents an \\nobvious challenge and vacancy in immuno-oncology.  \\n• \\nThe Phase 1/2 study of NC-318 was initiated in October 2018 in an ‘all-comer’ fashion in patients \\nwith advanced or metastatic solid tumors. Enrollment of the Phase 1 portion was completed in \\nAugust 2019 followed by data presentation in November 2019 at the SITC annual meeting. Based \\non the Phase 1 results, the Phase 2 portion of the trial started to enroll patients in October 2019, \\nand the company expects to announce initial data from the Phase 2 trial in 1H21. In addition, the \\ncompany intends to initiate another Phase 2 clinical trial to evaluate NC-318 in combination with \\nchemotherapy in patients with advanced or metastatic solid tumors in 1H21. \\n• \\nAs of November 9, 2019, promising early responses have been observed among 49 patients \\ntreated with NC-318 as monotherapy in its Phase 1 study including a 15% ORR achieved in 13 \\nNSCLC patients. Importantly, management was not surprised about the CR achieved with a low \\ndose (8 mg), because the dose-escalation study started within a potentially therapeutic range \\npredicted by preclinical studies. Moreover, it is still unclear whether it is necessary to saturate the \\ntarget in order to have a therapeutic effect for Siglec-15. We believe the biomarker data \\npresentation at the upcoming ASCO annual meeting (May 29-31, 2020) will help shed light on this \\nmatter.  \\n \\n \\nBiotechnology\\nMay 26, 2020\\n22\\n• \\nManagement also highlighted the safety profile of NC-318 during our conversation. Importantly, no \\nDLT has been observed through the doses tested (8, 24, 80, 240, 400 and 800 mg) until the \\nhighest 1,600 mg (where 1 DLT, Grade 3 pneumonitis was observed). In addition, all the immune-\\nrelated AEs such as diarrhea, rash, vitiligo and arthralgia are Grade 1 or 2 events.  The next focus \\nafter the ongoing monoagent dose-expansion trial will be combination studies. The company will \\nfocus on forming combinations with chemotherapies, while a combination with PD-1/L1 inhibitors \\nwill likely be evaluated through an investigator-sponsored study. Considering that combination \\ntherapies with chemotherapeutic agents or PD-1/L1 inhibitors is a trend in the I/O space, we see \\nthe initial clean safety profile as a key feature for potential success as the Phase 2 combination \\nstudy of NC-318 with chemotherapy is poised to start either 2H20 or 2021, depending on the \\ndynamic of the COVID-19 pandemic.  \\n• \\nNC-410 is the second clinical, wholly-owned asset of the company, which is decoy receptor \\ntargeting the ligands of LAIR-1, an inhibitory immune receptor often overexpressed in an \\nimmunosuppressive tumor microenvironment. Multiple preclinical studies support the notion that \\neliminating or blocking the binding of LAIR-1 restores normal immune function in multiple immune \\ncells against the tumor. The FDA accepted the IND of NC-410 in 1Q20 and the company intends to \\ninitiate a Phase 1/2 clinical trial in patients with advanced or metastatic solid tumors in 2H20.  \\n• \\nIn addition to the two lead assets, the company’s discovery engine, namely the FIND-IO platform, \\nshould not be ignored. Based on our conversation with management, we became aware that the \\nplatform is not T-cell centric. Instead, they recognize the importance of other cell types in initiating \\nan optimal immune response against tumors, including macrophages. Further, the FIND-IO \\nplatform can accommodate various screening needs to screen for over 9,000 proteins with different \\nfunctional readout, and it is not limited to oncology. Management mentioned it is also interested in \\ndiscovering novel autoimmune disease targets.  \\n• \\nNotably, the company possesses its own GMP manufacturing facility with a thousand-liter scale \\ncapability, a luxury for companies of similar sizes. In addition, a strong cash position of $322MM as \\nof the end of 1Q20, is sufficient to support the company’s operations into 2023, which is important \\nin today’s volatile financial and economic environment.  \\nUPCOMING MILESTONES \\nNC-318 Franchise \\n• \\nPotential to present the biomarker data of the Phase 1 study at the 2020 ASCO annual meeting \\n(May 29-31, 2020). \\n• \\nPotential data release of the top-line data from the monoagent Phase 2 study in 1H21. \\n• \\nPotential initiation of a Phase 2 study with chemotherapy in patients with advanced or metastatic \\nsolid tumors in 1H21. \\nNC-410 Franchise \\n• \\nPotential initiation of the first-in-human Phase 1/2 study in 1H21. \\n \\n \\n \\n \\nBiotechnology\\nMay 26, 2020\\n23\\nFIGURE 24.

Its most advanced clinical asset, NC-318, \\nis a monoclonal antibody targeting the inhibitory immune receptor Siglec-15. The company’s second \\nclinical asset, NC-410, is a decoy receptor targeting the ligands of the inhibitory immune receptor LAIR-\\n1. Therefore, both assets aim at addressing the tumor microenvironment and fulfilling the company’s \\nmission of treating cancer by ‘normalizing’ the immune cells trapped in an immunosuppressive tumor \\nmicroenvironment. In addition, the company developed and owns a powerful discovery engine, the \\nFIND-IO platform, which is capable of screening different cDNA libraries in different immune cells for \\ninducing a certain effect of interest.  \\nINVESTMENT RISKS \\nClinical risk. Novel biologic development is a relatively new business with inherent risks of all drug \\ndevelopment businesses in addition to the still non-standardized nature of the space. Clinical trials \\nalways carry a risk of failure and NXTC’s clinical assets may fail to demonstrate significant-enough \\nlevels of efficacy or safety in current or future clinical trials. \\nRegulatory and commercial risks. The ability of NXTC to market its product candidates in its pipeline \\ndepends upon those therapeutics obtaining approval from the FDA or foreign regulatory agencies. \\nFailure to achieve approval or delays in the timelines to approval could negatively impact the company’s \\nshare price. In addition, the company may opt to pursue accelerated approvals with clinical trials which \\nmay not have enough patients for the FDA or EMA to make a recommendation. \\nCompetitive risks. Immuno-oncology therapies development is an intensely competitive domain \\ndominated by biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies with expertise and resources that may be \\ngreater than NXTC’s. \\nFinancial risks. NXTC is currently well funded with cash, cash equivalents, and short-term \\ninvestments; however, the company will require additional equity financing in the form of a secondary \\noffering or non-dilutive capital to complete the development and commercialization of its product \\ncandidates. \\nDrug candidate\\nTarget\\nIndication\\nStage\\nRights \\nNC-318\\nSiglec-15\\nNSCLC and other \\nsolid tumors\\nPhase 2\\nWholly-owned\\nNC-410\\nLAIR-1\\nSolid tumors\\nPhase 1\\nWholly-owned\\nBiotechnology\\nMay 26, 2020\\n24\\nVALUATION \\nWe value biotechnology companies based on a blend of a discounted earnings per share and revenue \\nmultiple analysis. First, we evaluate the universe of profitable biotechnology companies and derive a \\nrevenue multiple range and EPS multiple range based on how these companies trade in both bear and \\nbull markets. To that end, we have ascertained a range of a 6-10x revenue multiple and a 26-30x \\nearnings per share multiple.  \\nApplying a 30x P/E multiple to our probability-adjusted 2029E earnings per share of $13.21 and \\ndiscounting by 30% over 8.6 periods, we obtain a fair value of $41.69 per share. Applying a 10x \\nrevenue multiple to our probability-adjusted 2029E revenues of $2.11B and discounting by 30% over \\n8.6 periods, we obtain a $48.96 per share fair value. Averaging the results from these two methods and \\nadding the estimated 1Q21 pro forma cash per share of ~$9.24, we derive a price target of $54.56, \\nwhich we round to $55 (Figure 25). \\n \\nFIGURE 25.

This \\nresults in an $85 fair value.

Specifically, a cDNA library with over \\n6,500 human genes encoding >90% of transmembrane proteins in the human genome was transfected \\ninto an artificial antigen-presenting cell line (aAPC), which was then incubated with a T cell line carrying \\na reporter. Therefore, the reporter signal was indicative of the T cell growth which could be affected by \\nthe different membrane-bound molecules expressed in the aAPCs through the cDNA library (Figure \\n27A). Using this assay, Siglec-15 was found to be an inhibitory signal on T cell expansion which was \\nunknown before (Figure 27B). Importantly, the screening result can be replicated using full-length \\nSiglec-15 or a hybrid molecule composed of the extra-cellular domain of Siglec-15 and the \\ntransmembrane domain from another molecule, suggesting the extracellular domain is the key (Figure \\n27C).  \\n \\nFIGURE 27. Discovery of Siglec-15 as a Novel Immune Checkpoint \\nMolecule \\n    \\n     Source: Wang J et al., Nat Med. 2019 \\n \\nImportantly, while the expression of Siglec-15 is very limited in normal cells and are only expressed by \\ncertain cell types such as macrophages, Siglec-15 is over-expressed by many types of tumor cells of \\ndifferent tissue origins, including bladder, colon, endometrial, kidney, lung, liver and thyroid (Figure 28).  \\n \\n \\n \\nBiotechnology\\nMay 26, 2020\\n27\\nFIGURE 28.

Therefore, it may potentially provide a unique therapeutic opportunity by targeting \\nSiglec-15 itself or in combination with a PD-1/L1 inhibitor (although based on our conversation with \\nmanagement, this strategy is likely to be pursued through investigational sponsored studies). \\n \\nFIGURE 29. Expression of Siglec-15 Does Not Overlap with PD-L1 in \\nTumors \\n                                           \\n \\n     Source: Wang J et al., Nat Med. 2019 \\n \\n \\nBiotechnology\\nMay 26, 2020\\n28\\nBased on this initial study and other literature, NextCure has formed a hypothesis that it has tested in \\npreclinical studies and currently in the clinic. The hypothesis suggests Siglec-15 is an immune \\ncheckpoint molecule highly expressed by tumor cells and macrophages (particularly the pro-tumoral M2 \\nsubtype). Therefore, it is possible to ‘normalize’ a cancer patient’s immune system for anti-tumor \\npurposes by disrupting this mechanism through a blocker, such as an anti-Siglec-15 monoclonal \\nantibody (Figure 30). \\n \\nFIGURE 30. Hypothesis for Targeting Siglec-15 in as Cancer \\nImmunotherapy \\n                   \\n                          \\n     Source: NextCure corporate deck, April 2020 \\n \\nDespite the penetration of PD-1/L1 inhibitors into the front-line treatment of multiple types of tumors, it is \\nestimated that up to 60% to 70% of cancer patients, including those with melanoma, renal cell cancer, \\ncolorectal cancer, NSCLC, urothelial cancer and HNSCC, do not respond to a single-agent anti-PD1/L1 \\ntherapy. Oftentimes, response to a treatment is also determined by the PD-L1 expression level in \\npatients’ tumors. For instance, in the current standard treatment landscape of NSCLC without genetic-\\ndriven mutations, treatment guidelines are decided by a tumor’s PD-L1 levels (TPS Score). For a tumor \\nwith PD-L1 ≥50%, the front-line treatment would be a PD-1 inhibitor followed by a second-line treatment \\nconsisting of a platinum doublet chemotherapy. Alternatively, for a tumor with PD-L1 <50%, the front-\\nline treatment option would be a combination of a PD-1 inhibitor and a chemotherapy, followed by \\ndocetaxel or clinical trial at the second line (Figure 31).  Therefore, based on the non-overlapping \\nexpression pattern of Siglec-15 and PD-L1, an anti-Siglec-15 therapy, if proven safe and efficacious in \\npatients, has the potential to address the unmet needs of low-PD-L1 expression tumors in the second-\\nline setting. \\n \\nFIGURE 31.

Using Siglec-15 knockout mice, the company has \\nshown that absence of Siglec-15 created a less favorable environment for tumor cells to grow in vivo \\ncompared to wild-type control, which resulted in a survival benefit to the mice transplanted with \\nxenograft tumor cells. Meanwhile, immune-phenotyping results demonstrated a higher number of CD8 \\nand CD4 positive T cells (but not macrophages and dendritic cells) in the knockout mice challenged by \\ntumor cells, as well as higher levels of cytokines with anti-tumor functions (Figure 32). Therefore, these \\ndata suggest inhibiting Siglec-15 is able to induce anti-tumor immune reactions through T cells. \\n \\nFIGURE 32. Lack of Siglec-15 Inhibits Tumor Growth In Vivo Via T Cell \\nExpansion \\n  \\n \\n     Source: NextCure presentation, SITC 2018 \\nThe NC-318 antibody was generated by immunizing the Siglec-15 knockout mice with a human Siglec-\\n15-Fc fusion protein. After a series of screening, purification and validation, the clone of 5G12 was \\nselected for further optimization, which led to the NC-318 antibody currently used in the clinic (Figure \\n33). \\n \\nFIGURE 33.

Notably, the single-agent activity of the \\nanti-Siglec-15 antibody was more pronounced than the anti-PD-1 antibody, while the combination of the \\ntwo generated the best efficacy, compared to control (Figure 35A). Consistently, the combination of the \\ntwo antibodies resulted in the best survival benefit to the mice, while anti-Siglec-15 alone seems to do \\nmoderately better than anti-PD-1. Importantly, the medium overall survival of the combination treatment \\nwas not reached at the end of the experiment in ~110 days post tumor inoculation, with tumor re-\\nchallenging two times at day 65 and 100 (Figure 35B).  \\nFIGURE 35.

The Phase 1 stage is an ‘all-comer’ study, followed \\nby a dose-expansion study in four chosen indications in the Phase 2 stage (Figure 37). The study is \\ndesigned to assess the safety and tolerability of NC-318, to define the maximum tolerable dose and/or \\npharmacologically active dose, and to assess preliminary efficacy. Patients receive NC-318 on day one \\nof each 14-day cycle. The Phase 1 portion was designed to determine the pharmacologically active \\ndose, defined as the dose that provides a maximal biologic effect, such as an increase in biomarkers of \\nimmune activation or a reduction of biomarkers associated with immune suppression, and/or the \\nmaximum tolerable dose of NC-318, including defining the optimal dose administration schedule and \\nthe maximum number of tolerated doses.  \\n \\nFIGURE 37. Trial Design of the Phase1/2 Study of NC-318 \\n \\n     Source: NextCure presentation, SITC 2019 \\n  \\n \\nBiotechnology\\nMay 26, 2020\\n32\\nNote that enrollment of the Phase 1 portion of the trial was completed in August 2019 and dosed 49 \\npatients across seven dose cohorts (8 mg, 24 mg, 80 mg, 240 mg, 400 mg, 800 mg and 1,600 mg). The \\nlast cohort (1,600 mg) was added to the trial, because a maximum tolerated dose had not been reached \\nthrough 800 mg. The most common tumors in the trial were NSCLC (n=13), ovarian (n=7), melanoma \\n(n=7), breast (n=4) and colorectal (n=3). Enrolled patients had all been subject to previous cancer \\ntreatments, with a median of three prior therapies, and all 13 NSCLC patients were PD-1 refractory and \\nhad been treated with a median of four prior therapies. In addition, most of the patients were seniors \\nwith a median age of 62 for all subjects and 68 for NSCLC. Gender is largely balanced as male and \\nfemale percentages are all in the range between 40% and 50%. Most of the patients had ECOG value \\nof 1 (67% for all subjects and 85% for NSCLC) (Figure 38), consistent with the late-stage characteristic \\nof the patient population.  \\n \\nFIGURE 38. Patient Characteristics at Baseline \\n    \\n  \\n     Source: NextCure presentation; data cutoff: September 2019 \\n \\nDespite being in a Phase 1 all-comer study, NC-318 has already shown some promising activity in \\nmultiple tumor types. Among the 49 patients (all inclusive), one complete response (CR) was achieved \\nin a NSCLC patient treated with the lowest dose of 8 mg, and a partial response (PR) in another \\nNSCLC patient treated with the 400 mg dose. Additionally, 20 stable disease (SD) objective responses \\nhave been achieved in patients with NSCLC, endometrial cell cancer, ovarian cancer, squamous cell \\ncarcinoma, Merkel cell cancer, and head and neck cancer. Together, these responses generated a \\nclinical benefit (CR+PR+SD) rate of 45% in these 49 patients. Importantly, many of the responses are \\ndurable as the CR remained ongoing at week 55, the PR remained ongoing at week 28, and 12 SD \\nstatuses were maintained at the last data cutoff in September, 2019. In total, 20 patients were still on \\ntreatment (Figure 39).  \\n \\n \\n \\nBiotechnology\\nMay 26, 2020\\n33\\nFIGURE 39. Efficacy Data of the Phase 1 All-comer Study \\n \\n     Source: NextCure presentation, SITC 2019 \\n \\nInterestingly, NSCLC patients seem to be particularly sensitive to the NC-318 treatment. Despite all of \\nthe patients had failed prior anti-PD-1 immunotherapy, a CR and a PR were achieved among the 13 \\npatients, in addition to three SD statuses. Eight out of the 13 patients remained in treatment at the last \\ndata cutoff (Figure 40).  \\nFIGURE 40. Phase 1 NC-318 Efficacy Data in NSCLC \\n             \\n \\n     Source: NextCure presentation, SITC 2019 \\n \\nOn the safety side, NC-318 was well tolerated for the 49 patients, as only two categories of Grade 3 or \\n4 (no Grade 5 events) were observed in very small percentages: 2% patients had increased amylase, \\nwhile 6% of patients had increased lipase. The rest of the treatment related AEs (>5%) are all mild \\n(Grade 1 or 2), while a few immune-related side effect cases were observed that include uveitis in one \\npatient, pneumonitis in two patients, and vitiligo in two patients (Figure 41).  \\n \\n \\nBiotechnology\\nMay 26, 2020\\n34\\nFIGURE 41. Safety Profile of the Phase 1 Study of NC-318 \\n    \\n     Source: NextCure presentation, SITC 2019 \\n \\nBased on the aforementioned Phase 1 efficacy and safety data, we believe it supports the Phase 2 \\ndose expansion study in selective indications, in particular NSCLC. We note that the company began \\nenrolling patients in the Phase 2 portion of the Phase 1/2 clinical trial of NC-318 in October 2019. The \\nPhase 2 portion of the trial is an open-label trial designed to detect a relevant efficacy signal, or \\nresponse rate, for each tumor type at a 400 mg dose administered every two weeks. Up to 100 patients \\nwith tumor types that have been shown to have elevated Siglec-15 expression, including NSCLC, \\novarian cancer, HNSCC and TNBC, will be enrolled. The primary endpoint is safety and tolerability, and \\nsecondary endpoints include objective response rate, progression-free survival, duration of response \\nand overall survival. The company expects to announce initial data from this portion of the trial by YE20. \\nIn addition, the company plans to initiate a second Phase 2 clinical trial to evaluate NC-318 in \\ncombination with standard-of-care chemotherapies in patients with advanced or metastatic solid tumors, \\na type of setting that has increased the use of CPIs in many indications. This trial will be an open-label \\nstudy designed to assess the safety and tolerability of NC-318 in combination with at least two different \\nchemotherapy regimens and to define the maximum tolerable dose of NC318 when administered with \\neach chemotherapy. The trial will also be designed to assess preliminary efficacy of each combination \\nin specific tumor types in a manner that can potentially support the use of such combinations in first-line \\ntherapies of advanced or metastatic solid tumors. \\nNC-410 \\nNC-410 is a fusion protein of LAIR-2, a naturally occurring decoy and inhibitory receptor against LAIR-1. \\nIt is designed to block immune suppression mediated by LAIR-1. The company hypothesizes that \\nblocking the binding of LAIR-1 restores normal immune function in multiple immune cells that were \\ndisrupted in TME, thereby promoting T cell function and dendritic cell activity to contribute to restoring \\nanti-tumor immune activity. The IND for this asset was cleared in 1Q20, and the company plans to \\ninitiate a Phase 1/2 clinical trial in patients with advanced or metastatic solid tumors in the 2Q20. \\nImportantly, the company has exclusive worldwide rights to the asset. \\n \\n \\nBiotechnology\\nMay 26, 2020\\n35\\nScientific rationale \\nLAIR-1 is a co-inhibitory receptor expressed on T cells and several other immune cell subsets, including \\nmonocytes, macrophages and dendritic cells. Its binding partners include certain types of collagen and \\ncomplement component 1q, or C1q. Under normal conditions, collagen forms a scaffold to provide \\nstrength and structure to tissues. C1q is part of the innate immune system to protect the host from \\ninfection and other foreign agents. Both collagen and C1q are highly upregulated and expressed under \\npathologic conditions, such as in the TME and in the immune organelles close to the tumor site known \\nas lymph nodes, which are important sites for mounting immune responses to the tumor. Under this \\ncontext, binding of LAIR-1 to collagen or C1q leads to immune suppression. However, the naturally \\ngenerated decoy receptor LAIR-2 can antagonize the immune suppression effect of LAIR-1, by \\ncompeting with the same ligands such as collagen and C1q. Since LAIR-2 is a secreted protein as \\nopposed to the membrane-bound LAIR-1, the presence of LAIR-2 is able to prevent LAIR-1 binding to \\nits targets. Importantly, LAIR-2 does not induce immune suppression when binding to these ligands. \\nNonetheless, under the harsh conditions of the TME, collagen and C1q are overexpressed. This \\ncombined with insufficient levels of natural LAIR-2 leads to net binding of LAIR-1, therefore favoring \\nimmune suppression. Consequently, it is logical to deliver an extra amount of LAIR-2 into the TME as \\nanti-LAIR-1 agent with a goal of normalizing the immune system to clear tumors (Figure 42). \\n \\nFIGURE 42. Counteracting the Immune Suppression of LAIR-1 by LAIR-2 \\n                                \\n  \\n     Source: Son M et al., Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2012 \\n \\nPreclinical characterization \\nThe company has conducted multiple preclinical studies to assess the activity of NC-410 across a \\nvariety of preclinical models. Specifically, the company has observed in vitro with human cells that using \\nNC-410 to block LAIR-1 from binding with collagen or C1q reverses immune suppression and restores \\nnormal immune cell function for both peripheral blood monocytes, including T cells, and myeloid cells. In \\none study, 0, 10 and 100 μg/mL of NC-410 was able to activate peripheral blood monocytes in the \\npresence of 20 μg/mL of collagen peptide in a dose-dependent manner. Similarly, 0, 2.5 and 10 μg/mL \\nof NC-410 was able to activate human myeloid cells in the presence of 10 μg/mL of C1q in proportion to \\nthe NC-410 concentrations (Figure 43). \\n \\n \\n \\nBiotechnology\\nMay 26, 2020\\n36\\nFIGURE 43. NC-410 Reversed Immune Suppression Mediated by \\nCollagen and C1q \\n                \\n \\n     Source: NextCure presentation \\n \\nIn addition, the company has shown that NC-410 was able to promote the generation of anti-tumor \\ncytokines IL-2 and TNF-α, and injections of NC-410 and human T cells in immune-deficient mice \\nresulted in increased amounts of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells (Figure 44), indicative of its ability to \\nstrengthen immune reaction. \\n \\nFIGURE 44.  NC-410 Promoted T Cell Expansion and Anti-tumor Cytokine \\nSecretion  \\n    \\n \\n     Source: NextCure presentation \\n \\nLastly, when human PBMCs were implanted into mice with mouse P815 mastocytoma tumor cells, the \\ncompany observed that NC410 mediated an increase in human T cells in vivo and that the increase in \\nhuman T cells correlated with a delay in tumor growth (Figure 45). \\n \\n \\n \\nBiotechnology\\nMay 26, 2020\\n37\\nFIGURE 45.  Treatment of NC-410 Decreased Tumor Volume In Vivo  \\n    \\n \\n     Source: NextCure presentation \\n \\nTaken together, these studies provide support to the notion that blocking the binding of LAIR-1 by LAIR-\\n2 to collagen or C1q can restore normal immune function by activating T cells and inducing an anti-\\ntumor immunity. Additionally, the company and others have analyzed genomic and protein databases \\nand observed that LAIR-1 expression levels negatively correlate with survival rates for several cancers, \\nincluding brain, renal, colorectal, glioma, lung, urothelial and ovarian cancers. These analyses support \\npossible targeting of these tumor types as primary indications for therapeutic treatment with NC-410. \\nTherefore, the company is conducting expansive screening efforts on tumor samples from different solid \\ntumor types to identify tumors that express LAIR-1 on the surface of either cancer cells or infiltrating \\nimmune cells to guide the ultimate selection of patients for planned clinical trials of NC-410 in humans. \\nINTELLECTUAL PROPERTY \\nAs of December 31, 2019, the company’s intellectual property portfolio includes 18 pending foreign \\npatent applications relating to NC-318 and NC-410 and one pending U.S. patent application relating to \\nNC-318, one pending U.S. patent application relating to NC-410 and additional pending patent \\napplications for other discovery and research programs.

We recommend \\nshares based on the company’s differentiated RBC-sparing CD47-targeting assets, including TTI-621 \\nand TTI-622. With Forty Seven (FTSV) recently acquired for $4.9B by Gilead for a monoclonal antibody \\ntargeting CD47, we believe Trillium may be leading the pack in the highly competitive space and, in our \\nopinion, should trade at a premium to current levels based on the best-in-class single-agent efficacy \\ndata demonstrated by TTI-621. With a strong cash position at $135MM, a new management team, and \\nthe company’s plan to focus on heme-malignancies such as MDS/AML, we believe Trillium represents a \\nunique investment opportunity, whose shares are attractively priced with ~20% potential downside (bear \\ncase is $5) and ~100% potential upside (bull case is $13). \\nKey takeaways: \\n• \\nThe only CD47-targeting agent with meaningful monotherapy objective responses. A range \\nfrom 18% to 29% ORR (which includes a handful of CRs) has been achieved in a variety of \\nrelapsed or refractory B‐ and T‐cell lymphomas in patients treated with up to 0.5 mg/kg of TTI-621 \\n(dose escalation is currently underway at 1.4 mg/kg). In contrast, Forty Seven’s magrolimab had \\npreviously demonstrated limited single-agent activity (5% ORR in solid tumors and lymphomas at \\n≥20 mg/kg, and 10% ORR in AML/MDS at 30 mg/kg) without any CRs noted in its clinical studies. \\n• \\nThe RBC-sparing clean safety profile should continue to provide an edge for TTI-621/622. To \\nour knowledge, Trillium possesses the only RBC-sparing CD47-targeting assets in the industry. \\nThis allows it to generate a targeting agent with a strong immune effector (i.e., IgG1 Fc region), \\nwhile competitors have to use a mild immune effector (i.e., IgG4 Fc region) in order to minimize the \\non-target side effect on RBCs. While not immune from hematological toxicities, the \\nthrombocytopenia demonstrated in clinical studies appears to be transient and reversible without \\ntreatment modification, disruption or discontinuation. These results are in comparison to the anemia \\ncaused by Forty Seven’s magrolimab which requires a special dose modification protocol. Taken \\ntogether, we believe a clean and superior safety profile is beginning to emerge for TTI-621 (dosed \\nin more than 200 patients), which we believe should differentiate the asset from competitors. \\n• \\nInjection of new energy with a new CEO and marquee shareholders. Dr. Jan Skvarka took \\nover as CEO beginning in September 2019, and the management has since implemented several \\nmajor changes at the company. A key injection of capital occurred in January 2020, maintaining the \\nkey existing institutional investors (e.g., New Enterprise Associates), as well as enroll multiple \\nmarquee names (e.g., Boxer Capital, Logos Capital, Vivo Capital, and Venrock Healthcare Capital \\nPartners). With a pro forma cash position of $135MM, we expect the monies to easily fund \\noperations through key inflection points. \\n \\nBiotechnology\\nMay 26, 2020\\n42\\nINVESTMENT THESIS \\nTrillium Therapeutics is a clinical-stage immuno-oncology company pioneering the development and \\ncommercialization of a unique type of CD47-targeting agent based on a human SIRPα decoy receptor \\nfor the treatment of cancer. The company is currently focused on building a robust clinical pipeline \\nsurrounding the two lead assets, TTI-621 and TTI-622, which target a novel immune checkpoint found \\non macrophages. To date, both the company’s and its competitors’ clinical data have demonstrated \\npromising clinical results in multiple types of hematologic malignancies including CTCL, PTCL, DLBCL, \\nMDS and AML, to name a few. Due to its current best-in-class mono-agent therapy data, the ability to \\nspare RBCs, and a clean safety profile generated with over 200 patients, we believe the company has \\nthe potential to take the lead in the race to develop therapies targeting CD47 for oncology. \\nWe believe the company’s current path should lead to a sustainable return on investment in the long \\nrun. Supporting this thesis is our estimate that the company has the potential to generate close to \\n$1.2B/year in revenues by the end of 2029, in our base scenario, from the company’s two lead assets \\n(TTI-621 and TTI-622) in multiple hematological malignancies. \\nIn the near term, TTI-621 is on track to continue dose-escalation studies in 2020, followed by a dose-\\nescalation study of TTI-622. Therefore, the company will be able to generate a level of flexibility with \\nboth strong (TTI-621) and moderate (TTI-622) immune stimulators, a luxury that none of its competitors \\nhave. In addition, we believe TTI-622’s clean safety profile is another key differentiator. We also see the \\ncurrent plan of focusing on bigger indications such as MDS and AML, as management’s commitment to \\ngenerating shareholder value. Lastly, the company has a strong cash position of $135MM (pro forma), \\nwhich we believe is sufficient to fund operations into 2022.  \\nGiven our belief the company’s clinical pipeline justifies a higher valuation than where the company \\ncurrently trades today, we suggest investors pay close attention to the clinical-stage product candidates, \\nespecially the following key assets with commercialization opportunities within the next three to four \\nyears: \\n• \\nTTI-621 is a SIRPα-Fc (IgG1) fusion protein that consists of the extracellular CD47-binding domain \\nof the human SIRPα receptor, linked to the Fc region of an IgG1 molecule. It is designed to act as a \\nsoluble decoy receptor, blocking CD47 from binding to the SIRPα receptor found on macrophages \\nand blocking the inhibitory (‘don’t eat me’) signal. Neutralization of the inhibitory CD47 signal \\nenables the de novo function of macrophage anti-tumor effects by leaving the phagocytic (‘eat me’) \\nsignals intact. The IgG1 Fc region of TTI-621 also assists in potent activation of macrophages and \\nNK cells by engaging Fc receptors at the site of the tumor. Further, due to the APC function of \\nmacrophages, T cells will also be activated after tumor cell phagocytosis by the macrophages. \\nImportantly, TTI-621 has shown meaningful single-agent activity by both local and systemic \\ndelivery in multiple B- and T-cell lymphoma indications in a range between 18% and 29% ORR with \\nlow doses (up to 0.5 mg/kg), while the current dose-escalation study continues at 1.4 mg/kg. \\n• \\nIn the clinic, TTI-621 has achieved a 19% ORR (including a CR) in 42 CTCL patients, an 18% ORR \\n(including 2 CRs) in 22 PTCL patients, and a 29% ORR (including a CR) in 7 DLBCL patients with \\nIV injection. Notably, all these objective responses were recorded using doses up to 0.5 mg/kg. \\nTherefore, we believe the response rates in the ongoing studies have the potential to increase even \\nfurther.  Of importance, the observation of a total of four CRs across multiple indications should not \\nbe ignored due to the still relatively small patient numbers in each indication evaluated.  \\n \\n \\nBiotechnology\\nMay 26, 2020\\n43\\n• \\nOn the safety side, no treatment-related ≥Grade 3 anemia has been observed, which is consistent \\nwith the preclinical characterization of TTI-621. Despite the initial concern of a thrombocytopenia \\nside effect which led to a premature declaration of a MTD, this concern has largely been resolved \\nsince the side effect appears to be transient and reversible within a week in the absence of \\ntreatment discontinuation or disruption. Importantly, the transient platelet decreases did not lead to \\nan increased risk of bleeding and merely one out of 179 patients had dosing discontinued due to \\nthrombocytopenia. The change of DLT criteria to Grade 4 thrombocytopenia lasting 72+ hours or a \\nplatelet count less than 10,000/ml at any time has allowed the continued dose escalation of TTI-\\n621 that is currently underway.  \\n• \\nTrillium’s second asset TTI-622 consists of the same human SIRPα decoy receptor as TTI-621 but \\nis linked to a human IgG4 Fc region, which has a decreased ability to engage Fc receptors found \\non macrophages and NK cells as compared to an IgG1 Fc. Presumably, this change should lead to \\na more moderate immune reaction by itself. However, it may offer flexibility for combination studies \\nlike the IgG4 CD47 mAb (magrolimab) from Forty Seven, which achieved a 92% ORR in 24 MDS \\nand 64% ORR in 22 AML patients in combination with azacitidine. Based on our conversation with \\nmanagement, MDS and AML are part of Trillium’s clinical plan for TTI-622 to form combination \\ntherapies in the future. \\n• \\nTTI-622 is currently in a Phase 1 study, with a ‘3+3’ dose-escalation design in lymphoma patients. \\nImportantly, five dose-level cohorts (0.1‐4 mg/kg) have been completed without DLTs. In addition, \\nno drug-related ≥Grade 3 anemia or thrombocytopenia was reported. Currently, the sixth cohort (8 \\nmg/kg) is underway and one CR has been observed in a DLBCL patient at a dose of 0.8 mg/kg. \\nAccording to the company’s business strategy, TTI-622 will be placed into the combination setting, \\nwhich we believe could directly compete with Forty Seven’s magrolimab in MDS and AML where \\nonly one PR was achieved in its monotherapy Phase 1 study. Finally, we expect the company to \\nidentify a RP2D for TTI-622 in 1H21 followed by an announcement of a combination study. \\nUPCOMING MILESTONES \\nTTI-621 Franchise \\n• \\nPotential to identify MTD or RP2D by YE20. \\n• \\nPotential to provide data update at the 2020 ASH annual meeting (December 5-8, 2020). \\n• \\nPotential to initiate a combination study with azacitidine in MDS/AML in 2H20 or 1H21.  \\nTTI-622 Franchise \\n• \\nData update for the dose escalation study at 2020 ASCO annual meeting (May 29-31, 2020). \\n• \\nPotential to identify MTD or RP2D in 2H20 or 1H21. \\n• \\nPotential to initiate a combination study with azacitidine in MDS/AML in 2H20 or 1H21.  \\n \\n \\n \\nBiotechnology\\nMay 26, 2020\\n44\\nFIGURE 49.

Its most advanced program, TTI-621, is a SIRPαFc fusion protein that consists of the \\nextracellular CD47-binding domain of human SIRPα receptor, linked to the Fc region of a human IgG1. \\nIt is designed to act as a soluble decoy receptor, preventing CD47 from engaging with its cognate \\nreceptor delivering its inhibitory (‘do not eat’) signal. Neutralization of the inhibitory CD47 signal \\nnormalizes the macrophage anti-tumor effects which can be further enhanced by pro-phagocytic (‘eat’) \\nsignals. Therefore, it is essentially an immune checkpoint inhibitor targeting tumor cells and \\nmacrophages, unlike most of the others (targeting tumor and T cells). The IgG1 Fc region of TTI-621 \\nmay also assist in the activation of macrophages by engaging Fc receptors. TTI-621 has shown single-\\nagent activity by both local and systemic delivery in multiple B- and T-cell lymphoma indications and \\nhas been well tolerated in over 200 patients to date. \\nThe company is also developing a second SIRPα-Fc fusion protein, TTI-622, which is in a Phase 1 \\nclinical trial. TTI-622 consists of the extracellular CD47-binding domain of human SIRPα linked to a \\nhuman IgG4 Fc region, which has a decreased ability to engage Fc receptors than an IgG1 Fc. Both \\nSIRPα-Fc fusion proteins enable CD47 blockade with different levels of Fc receptor engagement on \\nmacrophages and thus may offer the company a high level of flexibility tailored for different applications. \\nDrug candidate\\nTarget\\nIndication\\nStage\\nRights \\nPartner\\nTTI-621\\nCD47 inhibitor\\nHeme \\nmalignancies\\nPhase 1B\\nWholly-owned\\nNone\\nTTI-622\\nCD47 inhibitor\\nHeme \\nmalignancies\\nPhase 1A\\nWholly-owned\\nNone\\nBiotechnology\\nMay 26, 2020\\n45\\nINVESTMENT RISKS \\nClinical risk. Novel biologic development is a relatively new business with inherent risks of all drug \\ndevelopment businesses in addition to the still non-standardized nature of the space. Clinical trials \\nalways carry a risk of failure and TRIL’s clinical assets may fail to demonstrate significantly enough \\nlevels of efficacy or safety in current or future clinical trials. \\nRegulatory and commercial risks. The ability of TRIL to market its product candidates in its pipeline \\ndepends upon those therapeutics obtaining approval from the FDA or foreign regulatory agencies. \\nFailure to achieve approval or delays in the timelines to approval could negatively impact the company’s \\nshare price. In addition, the company may opt to pursue accelerated approvals with clinical trials which \\nmay not have enough patients for the FDA or EMA to make a recommendation. \\nCompetitive risks. Immuno-oncology therapies development is an intensely competitive domain \\ndominated by biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies with expertise and resources that may be \\ngreater than TRIL’s. \\nFinancial risks. TRIL is currently well funded with cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments; \\nhowever, the company will require additional equity financing in the form of a secondary offering or non-\\ndilutive capital to complete the development and commercialization of its product candidates. \\nBiotechnology\\nMay 26, 2020\\n46\\nVALUATION \\nWe value biotechnology companies based on a blend of a discounted earnings per share and revenue \\nmultiple analysis. First, we evaluate the universe of profitable biotechnology companies and derive a \\nrevenue multiple and EPS multiple range based on how these companies trade in both bear and bull \\nmarkets. To that end, we ascertain a 6-10x revenue multiple range and a 26-30x EPS multiple. \\nApplying a 30x P/E multiple to our probability-adjusted 2029E earnings per share of $2.89 and \\ndiscounting by 30% over 8.6 periods, we obtain a fair value of $9.11 per share. Applying a 10x revenue \\nmultiple to our probability-adjusted 2029E revenues of $1.25B and discounting by 30% over 8.6 periods, \\nwe obtain an $8.80 per share fair value. Averaging the results from these two methods and adding pro \\nforma cash per share of ~$1.18, we derive a price target of $10.14, which we round to $10. \\nFIGURE 50. Blended Discounted Earnings per Share and Revenue Multiple Analysis \\n   \\n     Source: JMP Securities LLC \\n \\nBull-Base-Bear Scenarios \\nIn our bull case, TTI-621 and TTI-622 provide strong efficacy and safety data in their ongoing Phase 1 \\nstudies, and enter registration-enabling Phase 2 trials in the next year or two, establishing high \\nprobabilities of success, resulting in an increase in risk-adjusted revenues. This results in a $13 fair \\nvalue. In our bear case, we assign low probabilities to the trials of TTI-621 and TTI-622, arriving at a $5 \\nfair value. \\n \\n \\n \\nMultiple\\n20%\\n25%\\n30%\\n35%\\n40%\\n24\\n$14.49\\n$10.21\\n$7.29\\n$5.27\\n$3.86\\n26\\n$15.69\\n$11.06\\n$7.90\\n$5.71\\n$4.18\\nEstimated 2029 EPS\\n2.89\\n$                     \\n28\\n$16.90\\n$11.91\\n$8.50\\n$6.15\\n$4.50\\nYear\\n2021\\n30\\n$18.11\\n$12.76\\n$9.11\\n$6.59\\n$4.82\\nPeriods (years)\\n8.6\\n35\\n$21.13\\n$14.88\\n$10.63\\n$7.69\\n$5.63\\nFair value\\n$9.11\\n40\\n$24.15\\n$17.01\\n$12.15\\n$8.79\\n$6.43\\n45\\n$27.16\\n$19.13\\n$13.67\\n$9.88\\n$7.23\\n50\\n$30.18\\n$21.26\\n$15.18\\n$10.98\\n$8.04\\nEstimated 2029 Revenues (000s)\\n1,253,204\\n$             \\n55\\n$33.20\\n$23.39\\n$16.70\\n$12.08\\n$8.84\\nYear\\n2021\\n60\\n$36.22\\n$25.51\\n$18.22\\n$13.18\\n$9.64\\nPeriods (years)\\n8.6\\nShares outstanding (000s):\\n149,722\\n                 \\nMultiple\\n20%\\n25%\\n30%\\n35%\\n40%\\nFair value\\n$8.80\\n6.0\\n$10.50\\n$7.40\\n$5.28\\n$3.82\\n$2.80\\n8.0\\n$14.00\\n$9.86\\n$7.04\\n$5.09\\n$3.73\\nAverage Fair Value Combining Both Methods\\n$8.96\\n10.0\\n$17.50\\n$12.33\\n$8.80\\n$6.37\\n$4.66\\n$1.18\\n12.0\\n$21.00\\n$14.79\\n$10.57\\n$7.64\\n$5.59\\nAverage Fair Value Including Cash Per Share\\n$10.14\\n14.0\\n$24.50\\n$17.26\\n$12.33\\n$8.92\\n$6.53\\nP/E Multiple\\nDiscounted Earnings Analysis\\nDiscounted Revenue Analysis\\nRevenue Multiple\\nCash/Share\\nBiotechnology\\nMay 26, 2020\\n47\\nFIGURE 51. Bull/Base/Bear Analysis \\n    \\n     Source: JMP Securities LLC, Thomson Reuters \\n \\n   LEAD ASSETS \\nTrillium is currently focused on its two SIRPα decoy receptors linked to an IgG1 (TTI‐621) or IgG4 (TTI‐\\n622) Fc region as a CD47 blocker and phagocytosis inducer. Due to the strong immune effector \\nfunction of IgG1 and a less potent IgG4, we believe TTI‐621 mainly serves as the prototype molecule \\nfor single-agent therapies, while TTI‐622 will be mostly likely used in the combination setting. The major \\ndifferentiating factor of TTI-621/622 is their inability to bind to human red blood cells (RBCs), unlike \\nmost other CD47 mAbs. In addition to SIRPα decoy receptors, the company has a STING agonist (TTI-\\n10001) in its pipeline, which works as a stimulator of interferon genes expression. The company is \\ncurrently searching for out-licensing partners for this asset.  \\n \\nFIGURE 52. Potency Difference of TTI‐621 and TTI‐622 \\n                                        \\n    \\n     Source: Trillium presentation \\n \\n \\nBiotechnology\\nMay 26, 2020\\n48\\nTTI‐621 (SIRPα-IgG1 Fc fusion molecule) \\nScientific rationale \\nImmunotherapy (I/O) has achieved great advances in the treatment of cancer, mainly through directing \\nthe ‘killers’ of the adaptive immune system, namely the T and B cells. However, the innate immune \\nsystem including macrophages, despite playing an essential role in an immune system, still represent a \\nlargely uncharted therapeutic area for cancer treatment.  Macrophages are the most important killer \\ncells in the innate immune system and they are often shielded in most tumor microenvironments (TME) \\nfrom attacking tumor cells by immune checkpoint mechanisms such as CD47/SIRPα. In addition, \\nmacrophages also serve as antigen‐presenting cells to activate the adaptive immune system once \\ntumor cells are phagocytosed. Therefore, while the whole I/O field is focusing on T cells, we believe \\nmanipulating macrophages have great potential to bring out novel therapies in the near future with their \\nunique immune checkpoint mechanism. In particular, recent advances in the understanding of the \\nCD47/SIRPɑ axis should provide such an opportunity for tackling the macrophages. \\nCD47 is a transmembrane protein that mainly functions as an anti-phagocytic break on the cells that \\nexpress it, enabling CD47-expressing cells to evade phagocytic elimination by macrophages and other \\nphagocytes. The inhibition occurs when CD47 binds to its cognitive receptor SIRPα on macrophages, \\nwhich will lead to a series of downstream signaling cascade that in turn prevent phagocytosis. \\nTherefore, mechanistically, it is highly reminiscent of the PD-1/L1 interaction involving T cells. In \\naddition to releasing the brake of the innate immunity to attack tumor cells, disrupting the interaction \\nbetween CD47 and SIRPɑ can also trigger an adaptive immune reaction, because macrophages are \\nimportant antigen presenting cells for adaptive immune activation (Figure 53). Therefore, we believe \\nCD47/SIRPɑ is an immune checkpoint, if manipulated properly, can serve as a key breakpoint for a full \\nimmune reaction against tumor cells.  \\n \\nFIGURE 53. Activate Both Innate and Adaptive Immunity by TTI‐621 \\n             \\n    \\n     Source: Trillium presentation \\n \\n \\n \\nBiotechnology\\nMay 26, 2020\\n49\\nA caveat is that the expression of CD47 or SIRPɑ is not specific to tumor or immune cells. For instance, \\nCD47 is expressed by RBCs in addition to tumor cells, and SIRPɑ is also expressed by neurons. To \\navoid the potential on-target side effects, most CD47 blocking antibodies for therapeutic purposes adapt \\nthe weak immune effector Fc subtype (e.g., IgG4), which will limit their monotherapy activity \\npresumably. In contrast, Trillium follows a different path by utilizing an intriguing finding the company \\nmade: wild-type human SIRPɑ receptor does not bind to human RBCs. Consequently, it is possible to \\nattach a strong immune effector (i.e., Fc region of IgG1) to a decoy wild-type human SIRPɑ receptor to \\ntarget the CD47 on tumor cells specifically and unleash a potent anti-tumor phagocytic effect through \\nthe Fcγ receptors on macrophages (Figure 54).  \\n \\nFIGURE 54. TTI‐621 Mechanism of Action \\n   \\n    \\n     Source: Trillium presentation \\n \\nPreclinical characterization \\nWhile the molecular mechanism as to why human SIRPɑ bind poorly to human RBCs is still largely \\nunclear, we believe the company has accumulated a large amount of preclinical data to demonstrate \\nthis phenomenon convincingly. First, using flow cytometry, the company has shown SIRPɑFc molecules \\nfailed to bind tightly to human RBCs, even though multiple CD47 mAbs could clearly do so (Figure 55). \\nImportantly, this is independent of either blood types or individuals (Figure 56). \\n \\nFIGURE 55.

SIRPɑFc Binds to AML Cells But Not RBCs \\n    \\n     Source: Trillium presentation; AACR 2014 \\n \\nWhen compared to Forty Seven’s proprietary CD47 mAb (5F9, or magrolimab), Trillium’s SIRPɑFc \\nmolecules clearly did not bind to RBCs, while 5F9 did. Interestingly, this cannot be due to difference in \\naffinity, as an engineered high affinity SIRPɑFc molecule was able to bind to RBCs just like the CD47 \\nantibodies (Figure 58). \\n \\nFIGURE 58. 5F9 But Not Wild-type SIRPɑFc Binds to RBCs \\n       \\n \\n     Source: Trillium presentation; AACR 2014 \\n \\n \\n \\nBiotechnology\\nMay 26, 2020\\n51\\nTaken together, we believe this is a highly desirable feature of TTI-621/622 for their ability to spare the \\npotentially on-target side effect on RBCs that can cause severe anemia. And it should allow for a more \\nflexible dosing schedule. By looking into the literature, we found at least two possible mechanisms that \\ncould explain this phenomenon: sparse (Figure 59A) or ‘buried’ (Figure 59B) distribution of CD47 \\nmolecules on the surface of human RBCs.  \\n \\nFIGURE 59. Potential Mechanisms for ‘SIRPɑ Escape’ by Human RBCs \\n                            \\n    \\n     Source: as stated in the figure \\n \\nSupporting the ‘clustering’ hypothesis, pre-clustering the CD47 molecules on human RBCs using non-\\nblocking anti-CD47 antibodies (ones that do not prevent the interaction between CD47 and SIRPɑ) \\ncompletely abrogated the original binding pattern of SIRPɑ and enabled its human RBC binding (Figure \\n60). Therefore, this experiment further validated the company’s key finding for TTI-621/622. \\n \\nFIGURE 60. ‘Pre-clustering’ CD47 Leads to Dramatic Increase of SIRPɑ on RBCs \\n                 \\n                     \\n     Source: Trillium presentation; AACR 2014 \\nApart from the potential RBC killing by anti-CD47 mAbs, RBC agglutination mediated by antibodies \\n(even when it does not trigger a potent immune killing reaction) can still lead to severe clinical \\ncomplications. Therefore, it is important to test this potential side effect for an anti-CD47/SIRPɑ agent. \\nAs Trillium’s preclinical data shows, unlike anti-CD47 mAbs including Forty Seven’s magrolimab, \\nTrillium’s SIRPɑFc molecules did not cause RBC agglutination as tested with an in vitro assay (Figure \\n61). Therefore, based on the aforementioned preclinical characterization, we believe Trillium’s SIRPɑFc \\nhas the potential to become a truly RBC-sparing CD47 inhibitor.  \\n \\n \\n \\nBiotechnology\\nMay 26, 2020\\n52\\nFIGURE 61. SIRPɑFc  Does Not Cause Human RBC Agglutination \\n    \\n     Source: Trillium presentation; AACR 2015 \\n \\nThe next important question becomes: does Trillium’s decoy receptor-Fc molecule kill the tumor cells \\njust as well? We take a look at the company’s anti-tumor preclinical data below.  \\nFirst, in vitro studies suggest treatment of the co-cultures of patient-derived primary tumor cells and \\nmacrophages with the SIRPɑFc dramatically increased the phagocytosis activity against tumor cells by \\n~200 fold compared to the control treatment. The difference can be seen very clearly under a \\nmicroscope with fluorescent immunostaining, where the tumor cells were labeled in green and the \\nperiphery of macrophages were labeled in red. In contrast to most green cells’ staying out of the red \\ncircles in the ‘no treatment’ or control Fc treatment (where a naked Fc molecule was expressed without \\nthe decoy receptor) condition, the SIRPɑFc treatment induced the engulfment of the majority of the \\ntumor cells (in green) into the microphages (in red circles), demonstrating occurrence of phagocytosis \\n(Figure 62). \\n \\nFIGURE 62. SIRPɑFc Enhances Macrophage-Mediated Phagocytosis of Tumor Cells \\n    \\n     Source: Trillium presentation; ASH 2015 \\n \\nConsistent with the company’s hypothesis, an enhanced antigen presentation effect was observed at \\nthe same time that the phagocytosis was enhanced, which in turn activated more CD8+ T cells and \\ntherefore potentially anti-tumor adaptive immunity (Figure 63). Together, it suggests the SIRPɑFc can \\ntrigger an extensive immuno-stimulatory effect involving both the innate and adaptive immune systems \\nagainst tumor cells. \\n \\n \\n \\nBiotechnology\\nMay 26, 2020\\n53\\nFIGURE 63.

First, \\nthe company has tested the efficacy of the SIRPɑFc in two Burkitt’s lymphoma models with high and \\nlow CD20 expression, respectively.

The trial \\nis being conducted in two phases and four parts that include: Phase 1a Part 1 (dose-escalation phase) \\nand Phase 1b Parts 2-4 (dose-expansion stage). \\nIn the dose-escalation phase (Phase 1a Part 1), patients with relapsed or refractory lymphoma were \\nenrolled in sequential dose cohorts to receive TTI-621 to characterize safety, tolerability, \\npharmacokinetics, and the maximum-tolerated dose (MTD).

IV TTI‐621 Dose-escalation Study Overview \\n \\n     Source: Trillium corporate deck, April, 2020 \\n \\nTo date, a total of 218 patients of various hematological cancers including AML, MDS, MPN, B‐NHL, T‐\\nNHL, HL, MM and CLL have been dosed with TTI‐621 intravenously.  The vast majority of them have \\nbeen treated with doses of 0.2 to 0.5 mg/kg/wk, due to the previous identification of 0.2 mg as a MTD \\nbased on the appearance of Grade 4 thrombocytopenia. However, considering thrombocytopenia can \\nbe part of the symptoms in this patient population at baseline, and the high grade events usually \\nresolved within a week without treatment modification, disruption or discontinuation, the company \\ndecided to modify the DLT criteria and allow the dose to continue to escalade in the absence of lasting \\n(72+ hours) Grade 4 thrombocytopenia, or very low platelet count (i.e., less than 10,000/ml) at any time.  \\nLooking at the pooled safety profile of the 218 patients (Figure 72), we believe it is very consistent with \\nthe preclinical data that we discussed above, because only 13% of the patients experienced anemia of \\nany grade, which is also a symptom frequently observed in the relapsed or refractory hematological \\ncancer patients. Among them, Grade ≥3 events only occurred in 8% of the patients. This is in stark \\ncontrast to magrolimab’s (Forty Seven’s anti-CD47 mAb) 89% (any grade), or 72% (Grade ≥3) anemia \\nrate recorded in its single-agent study. Unexpectedly, thrombocytopenia turned out to be a seemingly \\ndose-limiting side effect. However, the median platelet level of all the treated patients recovered to \\nbaseline in about a week, and remained stable thereafter for at least 12 weeks, without treatment \\nmodification, disruption or discontinuation. Notably, only one out of 179 patients discontinued treatment \\ndue to thrombocytopenia (Figure 73). This clearly suggests that the thrombocytopenia side effect is \\nreversible and manageable, and supports the company’s current decision to continue dose escalation in \\nthe absence of lasting or severe thrombocytopenia.  \\n \\n \\n \\nBiotechnology\\nMay 26, 2020\\n58\\nFIGURE 72.

Reversible Thrombocytopenia in the TTI‐621 Treated Patients  \\n \\n     Source: Trillium presentation; Shou, T Cell Lymphoma Forum 2019 \\n \\nApart from the reversible thrombocytopenia, the other frequent side effect is infusion related. This \\ntogether with the rest of the side effects are either easily manageable or in low grade or frequency. \\nTherefore, we believe TTI‐621 has achieved a very good safety profile at the dose range of 0.2-0.5 \\nmg/kg/wk, and will support the ongoing continuous dose escalation beyond 1 mg. Notably, the 1.0 \\nmg/kg dose has been cleared, and the first patient of the 1.4 mg/kg has been treated in CTCL.  \\nSwitching to the efficacy side, we believe TTI‐621, as a monotherapy, is currently the winner among all \\nthe CD47 targeting agents. Specifically, a range between 18% and 29% ORR has been achieved in B \\nand T cell lymphomas by TTI‐621, while only 5-10% ORR has been achieved in all the monotherapy \\nstudies of magrolimab including lymphomas and leukemia.

Notably all these responses were obtained using low doses up \\nto 0.5 mg/kg/wk. Interestingly, the combination with rituximab did not increase the response rate from \\nsingle-agent treatment (24% ORR). In addition, 4 out of the 71 lymphoma patients achieved a CR, \\nrepresenting ~6% CR rate, a result that may not sound impressive but is unprecedented among all the \\nCD47-targeting agents (Figure 75). Taken together, we believe the outstanding monotherapy activity of \\nTTI‐621 is another differentiating factor, in addition to the RBC-sparing safety profile. We believe these \\ntwo factors will facilitate company’s clinical plans in combination settings as well.  \\n \\nFIGURE 75.

However, several of them have discontinued their \\nprograms due to lack of efficacy (Figure 85). We believe only Forty Seven (which was acquired by \\nGilead) remains as a major competitor to Trillium, with its lead asset magrolimab, an anti-CD47 mAb.  \\n \\nFIGURE 85.

At the center of the company’s clinical programs is the \\nlead asset magrolimab (Hu5F9-G4), a humanized, IgG4, anti-CD47 monoclonal antibody (mAb) and a \\nproprietary macrophage checkpoint inhibitor for the treatment of a variety of liquid and solid tumors. By \\nblocking the ‘don’t eat me’ signal for the macrophages, it also opens up the opportunity to boost the \\npotential antitumor activity by creating additional ‘eat me’ signals, or forming synergy with T cells by \\nanti-PD-1/L1 therapies. This is exactly how the company has laid out their clinical trials by evaluating \\nthe safety and efficacy of magrolimab as monotherapy, and in combination with a chemotherapy, tumor \\ncell-targeted antibody (i.e., anti-CD20 or anti-cKit), or PD-1/L1 inhibitor (Figure 86). \\n \\nFIGURE 86.

In \\naddition, primary AML patient samples displayed increased expression of CD47 on the cell surface \\ncompared to normal cell counterparts. Further, higher levels of CD47 is associated with poor survival in \\nAML patients (Figure 87). Similar pre-clinical findings were observed in MDS patients, where the level of \\nCD47 is negatively correlated with disease risk. \\n \\nFIGURE 87.  CD47 Expression is Associated with Poor Clinical Outcomes in AML \\n       \\n \\n     Source: Majeti R et al., Cell. 2009 \\n \\nAML is a type of leukemia (comprising over 30% of leukemias), which means cancer of white blood \\ncells. It was estimated that more than 21,000 patients were diagnosed in U.S. in 2019. It usually starts \\nwith abnormal outgrowth of myeloblasts (a type of white blood cell progenitor) in the bone marrow, \\nwhich fail to further differentiate into mature white blood cells. AML arises when young abnormal white \\nblood cells called blasts (leukemia cells) begin to fill up the bone marrow, preventing normal blood \\nproduction. Consequently, there is less room for healthy white blood cells, red blood cells, and platelets. \\nWhen this happens, infection, anemia, or easy bleeding may occur. The leukemia cells can spread \\noutside the blood to other parts of the body, including the central nervous system (brain and spinal \\ncord), skin, and gums, etc. Current treatment options for AML include chemotherapy (‘7+3’, 7 days of \\ncytarabine followed by 3 days of an anthracycline or an anthracenediones, such as daunorubicin), \\nhypomethylating agents such as azacitidine, and hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) (Vago \\nL et al., J Clin Invest. 2020). However, AML still remains a fatal disease as approximately 11,000 death \\noccurred due to AML in 2019 alone in U.S, and five-year overall survival rate for AML is ~27% \\naccording to the NCI.   \\n \\n \\nBiotechnology\\nMay 26, 2020\\n67\\nMDS is a group of diverse bone marrow cancers in which the bone marrow does not produce enough \\nhealthy blood cells. In MDS, the stem cells in the bone marrow do not mature properly and may \\naccumulate in the bone marrow or they may have a shortened life span, resulting in fewer than normal \\nmature blood cells in the circulation. Consequently, cytopenias including anemia, thrombocytopenia, \\nleukopenia and neutropenia often manifest in the patients. It has been estimated around 12,000 to \\n20,000 new cases of MDS occur each year in the U.S. and up to 87,000 new cases/year worldwide.  \\nNotably, MDS is primarily a disease of the elderly (most patients are older than age 65) and it is more \\ncommon in men than in women. The current treatment options for MDS patients include supportive care \\n(which aims to relieve the symptoms), chemotherapy (with azacitidine being the standard front-line drug \\nfor high-risk MDS), immuno-suppressive therapy (for LR-MDS patients who develop cytopenia as a \\nconsequence of hyperactivated T cells), targeted therapy and HSCT. Importantly, despite the fact that \\nMDS is considered as a less malignant bone marrow cancer than AML, approximately 30% of the MDS \\npatients progress to AML over time. Therefore, the average survival rate of MDS patients can range \\nfrom five years or longer (in the low risk group) to several months (in the high risk group) according to \\nthe Aplastic Anemia and MDS International Foundation.  \\nPhase 1 monotherapy studies \\nSince CD47 is expressed in normal red blood cells (RBCs) in addition to cancer cells, the company \\ncame up with a unique dosing strategy of magrolimab in order to bring the on-target side effect of \\nanemia under control. This dosing regimen has been evaluated in two Phase 1 monotherapy studies \\n(NCT02678338 for advanced liquid tumors and NCT02216409 for advanced solid tumors), and the \\nresults support the feasibility well. In both studies, patients were treated with a low starting dose of \\nmagrolimab (twice weekly) for a week as ‘priming’, followed by a high, therapeutic dose (twice weekly) \\nthereafter as ‘maintenance’. This is based on the hypothesis that an initial lower “priming” dose would \\nbe sufficient to trigger clearance of aged RBCs and would yield an overall younger pool of RBCs, less \\nvulnerable to subsequent higher therapeutic “maintenance” doses.  \\nPreclinical data show that when fluorescently labeled RBCs from anti-CD47 mAb untreated (WT) and \\ntreated (Pruned) mice were transfused into treatment naïve or anti-CD47 mAb pre-treated recipients, \\nthe pruned RBCs were rapidly cleared in treatment naïve recipients while exhibiting a significantly \\nimproved survival in pre-treated mice (Figure 88). These data suggest the ‘priming’ dosing is protective \\nfor RBCs in the context of continued anti-CD47 ‘maintenance’ therapy. \\n \\nFIGURE 88.

Interestingly, the \\nhemoglobin level was inversely correlated with that of reticulocytes (which are immature RBCs), \\nsuggesting new RBC generation was stimulated by the priming dose and returned to normal (Figure \\n89). Additionally, the priming appeared to only affect RBCs but not white blood cells (WBCs) in liquid \\nand solid tumor patients, supporting the selectivity of magrolimab and the dosing strategy (Figure 90).  \\n \\nFIGURE 89.

Specifically, an \\naverage hemoglobin drop of 0.95 g/dL was seen with magrolimab dosing across all the patients, and \\nonly three patients had an initial hemoglobin drop of ≥3 g/dL with the first priming dose. In addition, no \\nsevere (≥Grade 3) RBC agglutination (RBC clumping caused by the antibodies) was observed. The \\nobserved RBC agglutination events were largely on peripheral smear, but not on sensitive, \\nmicrovasculature rich organs such as eyes (Figure 94).   \\n \\nFIGURE 93.

Therefore, the addition of a partner becomes almost a natural choice, which led to \\nthe Phase 1b 5F9005 study (NCT03248479) evaluating magrolimab as monotherapy or in combination \\nwith azacitidine in patients of AML or MDS in the U.S.  \\nAzacitidine (AZA) is a DNA methyltransferase (DNMT) inhibitor whose treatment results in a hypo-\\nmethylation status of DNA in the cells, while many leukemia cells rely on a hyper-methylation status to \\nshut down the expression of many tumor suppressor genes. Therefore, AZA, by itself, is an anti-\\nleukemic agent through a completely different mechanism of action (MOA) than magrolimab, and it has \\nbeen approved for treating both high-risk MDS and AML at the front-line setting. Additionally, AZA \\ntreatment also results in up-regulation of calreticulin (CRT) on the surface of AML cells (Figure 97), \\nwhich provides an ‘eat me’ signal to the phagocytic macrophages, in addition to removing the ‘don’t eat \\nme’ signal with CD47 blocking. Therefore, the combination of magrolimab and AZA provides synergistic \\nantitumor effects for the macrophages.  \\n \\n \\nBiotechnology\\nMay 26, 2020\\n73\\nFIGURE 97.

In the second arm, patients with previously untreated \\nAML who are ineligible for standard induction chemotherapy, or previously untreated intermediate/high-\\nrisk MDS, were screened and enrolled to receive magrolimab in combination with AZA. Tolerable \\npatients were assessed at the end of eight weeks for response. Similar to the previous Phase 1 trial in \\nthe UK, all patients started with a low dose (1mg/kg) of magrolimab as priming and ramp up to 30 mg/kg \\nby the end of week 2 in order to mitigate the on-target anemia. Upon cycle 3 (28 days/cycle), patients \\nreceive magrolimab every other week.

The investigational drug was given twice weekly \\nthrough week 2, then weekly thereafter. For AZA treatment, a 75 mg/m2 dose was given to the patient in \\nthe first seven days of a 28-day cycle. Safety and tolerability along with overall response rate (ORR) \\nwere the primary endpoints, while PK, PD and other efficacy parameters such as duration of response \\n(DOR), progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) are key secondary objectives (Figure \\n99).  \\n \\nFIGURE 99.

A total of 62 \\ntreatment-naïve patients have been treated with magrolimab + AZA and are evaluable for safety, \\nincluding 35 MDS and 27 AML patients. Notably, a majority of the patients (66% MDS and 67% AML) \\nhad poor cytogenetic risk at baseline. For the AML patients, 70% of them belong to the MRC subtype \\ncharacterized by underlying myelodysplasia (which suggests accumulation of immature blood cells in \\nthe bone marrow), while 41% of them had TP53 mutations. For the MDS patients on the other hand, the \\ndisease was likely caused by therapy in 31% of them (therapy-related). We note 51% of them had high \\nIPSS-R scores while another 31% had intermediate scores, suggesting high disease risks at baseline. \\nIn addition, the medium age is 70 for the MDS arm and 74 for the AML arm, consistent with the seniority \\nof these two patient populations (Figure 101).  \\n \\nFIGURE 101.

After all, no death was \\nreported, and only one patient stopped treatment due to an AE, resulting in a discontinuation rate of \\n1.6% (1/62).  \\n \\nFIGURE 102.

Instead, serum hemoglobin levels recovered quickly after the priming stage, and even \\nimproved over time (Figure 103A). Importantly, this is correlated with a decrease of RBC transfusion \\nfrequency the patients needed, suggesting authentic clinical benefit from the treatment (Figure 103B).  \\n \\nFIGURE 103.

Neutrophil and Platelet Improvement by Treatment \\n       \\n    \\n     Source: Sallman DA et al., 2019 ASH annual conference oral presentation \\n \\nBeyond hematologic improvements, very impressive objective response rates have been achieved in \\nthe treatment-naïve MDS and AML patients treated with magrolimab + AZA during the study among the \\n46 patients evaluable for efficacy. In particular, a 92% ORR (22/24, which includes 50% CR) and 100% \\nCBR (clinical benefit rate, CR+PR+SD) has been observed in the MDS patients, while a 64% ORR \\n(14/22, which includes 55% CR/CRi) and 96% (21/22) CBR have been recorded for AML (Figure 105). \\nThese data are in contrast to what has been recorded when AZA alone was used in the similar setting. \\nFor example, an ORR of only 16% to 22% was recorded when AZA alone was evaluated in MDS \\npatients (FDA label; Kenealy M et al., Haematologica. 2019). In AML, ORRs of 19% to 45% have been \\nreported with AZA alone (Pleyer L et al., Int J Mol Sci. 2017; Pleyer L et al., J Hematol Oncol. 2013). \\nImportantly, the median time to response is as short as 1.9 months in the combination therapy, while \\nAZA alone may take up to four months to see a response (Pleyer L et al., J Hematol Oncol. 2013). \\n \\nFIGURE 105. Anti-Leukemic Activity of Magrolimab + AZA in MDS and AML \\n     \\n \\n     Source: Sallman DA et al., 2019 ASH annual conference oral presentation \\n \\n \\n \\nBiotechnology\\nMay 26, 2020\\n78\\nThe clinical benefits of the magrolimab + AZA go further beyond the high response rates, as \\ndemonstrated by the depth and durability of the responses. Specifically, 44% of the MDS patients and \\n73% of the AML patients who were dependent on RBC transfusion became transfusion-independent \\nafter the treatment. In addition, cytogenetics normalized in 26% of the MDS patients and 60% of the \\nAML patients who had abnormal parameters at baseline. Moreover, MRD negativity (which correlates \\nwith better disease prognosis) was achieved in 23% of the MDS responders and 57% of the AML \\nresponders. Also, 15% of patients (7/46) received an allogeneic stem cell transplant and continue in \\nresponse. Importantly, median duration of response (mDOR) or median overall survival (mOS) has not \\nbeen reached in either patient population with a median follow-up time of 6.4 months for MDS and 8.8 \\nmonths for AML. We noticed that a MDS patient achieved a CR with the treatment followed by a HSCT \\nhad remained in CR for over 14 months. Additionally, two other transplantation-naive patients achieved \\nCR and had remained in treatment and CR for over eight months. On the other hand, two AML patients \\nachieving CR/CRi with treatment followed by HSCT were still remission-free for over 14 and 16 months, \\nrespectively. And another transplantation-naïve patient had been on CR and treatment for over 13 \\nmonths (Figure 106). Taken together, we believe these data represent very significant clinical benefits \\nto the patients, and bode well for an anti-CD47 class of therapeutics.  \\n \\nFIGURE 106. Deep and Durable Responses in Magrolimab + AZA Treated Patients \\n              \\n \\n     Source Sallman DA et al., 2019 ASH annual conference oral presentation \\n \\nInterestingly, the magrolimab + AZA treatment seems to be particularly potent against AML with TP53 \\nmutation, a poor prognosis population. Among the nine such patients treated, a 78% ORR has been \\nachieved including a 44% CR rate. In addition, 67% of the patients with abnormal cytogenetics achieved \\ncomplete cytogenetic response, and 57% of the responders reached the MRD negative state. Further, \\nboth mDOR and mOS has not been reached in a median follow-up time of 6.9 months. Last but not \\nleast, magrolimab + AZA treatment reduced the TP53 mutation burden to largely a minimal level (<5% \\nVAF, variation frequency), which is correlated with better survival outcome (Figure 107). Notably, these \\ndata are favorable even when compared to another AZA combination therapy (venetoclax +AZA) for \\nfront-line chemo-ineligible AML patients, where an ORR of 47% was achieved with mDOR of 5.6 \\nmonths and mOS of 7.2 months (DiNardo CD et al., Blood. 2019).  \\n \\n \\n \\nBiotechnology\\nMay 26, 2020\\n79\\nFIGURE 107.

By collaborating with MD Anderson Cancer Center, the company observed increasing \\namounts of CD3 (a pan-T cell marker) positive, CD4 positive and CD8 positive T cells in the bone \\nmarrow (where the cancer originated) of the AML patients treated by magrolimab + AZA. On the other \\nhand, the number of regulatory T cells (which are associated with pro-tumoral immune activity) did not \\nchange in the objective responders while elevating in sub-optimal responders (SD) (Figure 108). Barring \\nthe same phenomenon is not seen in AML patients treated with AZA alone, we believe these results \\nsuggest an intriguing synergistic effect between the innate and adaptive immunity triggered by \\nenhancing phagocytosis induced via the combination of blocking the ‘don’t eat me’ signal (CD47) and \\nboosting the ‘eat me’ signal (AZA treatment). \\n \\nFIGURE 108.

With the on-target side effect anemia \\nlargely manageable and a very low treatment discontinuation rate (1.6%), high response rates (92% \\nORR, 50% CR for MDS, and 64% ORR, 55% CR/CRi for AML), as well as potentially long durability \\n(mDOR not reached, 6.4 months of medium follow-up time for MDS, and 8.8 months for AML), based \\non these data, Forty Seven (now Gilead) has decided to seek registration in front-line higher-risk MDS \\npatients and front-line chemo-ineligible AML patients with TP53 mutations. The priority has been given \\nto higher-risk MDS. We should expect to see an update for the ongoing Phase 1b trial in mid-2020, and \\nthe company can potentially seek accelerated FDA approval based on the primary endpoint of ORR by \\nenrolling a total of approximately 90 patients. An additional Phase 3 ENHANCE trial will be initiated in \\n2Q20 to evaluate the combination of magrolimab + AZA compared to AZA alone with survival benefits \\nas primary endpoints in patients with untreated, higher-risk MDS, which should support a full FDA \\napproval or ex-U.S. approvals. \\nMagrolimab + AZA in DLBCL and FL \\nRelapsed or refractory NHL is the second major indication where magrolimab is being evaluated with a \\ncombination of rituximab, a long-approved anti-CD20 antibody for treating NHL. Similar to AZA, \\nrituximab binding to the tumor cells can provide additional ‘eat me’ signals to the phagocytic \\nmacrophages through the antibody’s Fc region. Accordingly, a preclinical study showed that while \\nrituximab alone failed to inhibit the growth of a NHL cell line, and magrolimab alone could only do so \\nmarginally in a xenograft mouse model, the combination of the two had a dramatic effect on \\nsuppressing tumor cell growth in vivo (Figure 109). Therefore, these data provided a scientific rationale \\nfor the trial.  \\n \\nFIGURE 109. Synergy Between Magrolimab and Rituximab \\n    \\n     Source: Forty Seven presentation \\n \\nNon-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) is cancer that originates from lymphocytes. In the U.S., ~85% of the \\nlymphomas diagnosed are B-cell lymphomas, ~10% are T-cell lymphomas, and the rest of unknown cell \\norigin. NHL is also the most common type of lymphoma.  Among NHL, the diffuse large B-cell \\nlymphoma (DLBCL) is the most common form of aggressive NHL \\n, accounting for ~30% of the \\nnewly diagnosed NHL cases. On the other hand, follicular lymphoma (FL) is the most common indolent \\nlymphoma, accounting for ~20% of NHL cases. Histologically, DLBCL is called ‘diffuse’ because the \\ncancer cells spread out within the tumor and destroy the normal structure of the lymph node, while FH is \\ncalled ‘follicular’ because the cancer cells tend to clump together, as follicles, in the lymph node. \\nAccordingly, DLBCL advances rapidly, and median survival is less than one year without treatment, \\nBiotechnology\\nMay 26, 2020\\n81\\nwhile FH can stay stable for many years, and the patients may not require immediate treatment if they \\ndo not display symptoms.  \\nSOCs for DLBCL include immunotherapy (i.e., anti-CD20 mAbs such as rituximab), immunomodulators \\n(i.e., lenalidomide, or Revlimid), chemotherapies, targeted therapy (i.e., brentuximab vedotin, a CD30 \\ntargeting antibody-drug conjugate), and radiation. More recently, CAR-T cell therapies have also been \\napproved and have shown promising activity against DLBCL. However, despite being responsive \\ninitially and curable in over 60% of cases, patients who did not respond to the current therapies or \\nrelapse have very poor survival with mOS of only 6-7 months (Crump M et al., Blood. 2017). The unmet \\nneeds remain to increase initial cure rates and improve long-term outcomes for the relapsed patients, \\nparticularly for patients who are primary refractory, CAR-T cell therapy ineligible, or in late line therapies \\nand have limited options. \\nTreatments for FL vary depending on the stage or form of the disease, but in general include the \\nfollowing options: anti-CD20 mAbs, chemotherapy, PI3K inhibitors (i.e., idelalisib, duvelisib and \\ncopanlisib), lenalidomide, radiation therapy (i.e., involved-site radiation therapy, or ISRT), stem cell \\ntransplantation and CAR-T cell therapy. Recently, the CD19 CAR-T cell therapy Kymriah was approved \\nfor FL.  Regarding outcomes, despite most patients respond initially, FL usually recurs and becomes \\nmore and more difficult to treat after each relapse, with decreasing mPFS which is as long as 4.8 years \\nafter the first-line treatment and decreases gradually to as short as 0.5 years after five lines of therapies \\n(Alperovich A et al., Blood, 2016). Therefore, there is no cure for FL currently, and the goal is to keep \\npatients longer in remission and to improve the long-term outcomes. In addition, well-tolerated, chemo-\\nfree regimens that induce durable responses are welcomed in late line patients. \\nPhase 1b/2 5F9003 study \\nThe trial is composed of two parts: a Phase 1b dose-escalation part in relapsed/refractory (r/r) NHL \\npatients, and a Phase 2 expansion part with two separate cohorts for DLBCL and indolent lymphoma, \\nrespectively. The goal is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of magrolimab + rituximab in the NHL \\npopulations. Similar to the previous studies, a low dose (1 mg/kg) of magrolimab is used to start in each \\npatient as the priming strategy to mitigate on-target anemia, followed by a dose up to 45 mg/kg in the \\nPhase 1b stage. In addition, a weekly schedule is made for the first two cycles, followed by a once \\nevery other week schedule as the ‘maintenance’ dose. On the other hand, rituximab is given to the \\npatient in 375mg/m2, as its standard dose approved for NHL. However, rituximab is dosed weekly for \\nCycle 1 (28 days/cycle), then monthly through Cycles 2-6 and every other month thereafter. Regarding \\npatient eligibility, r/r NHL patients relapsed or refractory to at least two prior lines of therapy are \\nscreened and enrolled into the study in the Phase 1b stage. In the Phase 2 stage, additional criteria are \\nincluded in the DLBCL cohort, such as the requirement of being rituximab-refractory, and not having \\nreceived CAR-T cell therapy (Figure 110).  \\n \\n \\nBiotechnology\\nMay 26, 2020\\n82\\nFIGURE 110. 5F9003 Study Design \\n            \\n    \\n     Source: Forty Seven presentation \\nIn the last data update reported during the EHA annual conference in 2019, a total of 115 NHL patients \\nhad been treated with 70 of them being DLBCL and 45 being indolent lymphoma patients (41 FL and 4 \\nMZL).
